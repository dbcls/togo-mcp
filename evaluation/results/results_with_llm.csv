The record has been held by several small protein structures determined by ultra-high resolution X-ray crystallography. One notable example is **crambin**, a small plant protein, which has had structures solved at resolutions approaching **0.48 Å** or even slightly better in some refinements.

At these ultra-high resolutions, individual hydrogen atoms can often be directly observed in the electron density maps, and very fine structural details including alternate conformations, subtle bond length variations, and detailed solvent structure become visible.

It's worth noting that:
- Such high resolutions are typically only achievable for very small, well-ordered proteins that form excellent crystals
- The vast majority of PDB structures are in the 1.5-3.0 Å range
- Resolutions below 0.6 Å are extremely rare

The exact record may have changed over time as new structures are deposited, but resolutions in the 0.48-0.54 Å range represent the best ever achieved for macromolecular crystallography in the PDB.",,9.040306091308594,52,272,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! I found the answer. Let me get a bit more information about these top structures:

The **highest resolution ever achieved for a structure in the PDB is 0.48 Ångströms (Å)**, which is shared by two structures:

1. **PDB ID: 5D8V** - Ultra-high resolution structure of high-potential iron-sulfur protein
2. **PDB ID: 3NIR** - Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 Å resolution

Both were determined using X-ray crystallography. This represents an extraordinary level of detail - at 0.48 Å resolution, individual atoms and even electron density distributions can be visualized with exceptional clarity. For context, typical high-resolution protein crystal structures are around 1.5-2.0 Å, so 0.48 Å is exceptionally rare and represents the pinnacle of crystallographic resolution.

Other notably high-resolution structures include:
- **1EJG** at 0.54 Å (crambin)

To find ChEMBL molecules with IC50 values less than 100 nM against kinase targets, you would typically:

## Search Strategy:

1. **Target Selection**: Filter for kinase targets (protein targets classified as kinases)
2. **Activity Type**: Select IC50 measurements
3. **Activity Value**: Set threshold < 100 nM
4. **Data Quality**: Consider filtering for:
   - Confidence score (ideally 8 or 9)
   - Direct interactions (assay type 'B' for binding)
   - Specific activity relationships

## Example Query Approach:

Using ChEMBL web interface or API, you would search for:
- **Target Type**: ""SINGLE PROTEIN"" with kinase classification
- **Standard Type**: ""IC50""
- **Standard Value**: < 100 (with units in nM)
- **Standard Relation**: ""="" or ""<""

## What You'd Find:

ChEMBL contains **hundreds of thousands** of such compounds, as kinase inhibitors are heavily studied in drug discovery. Many approved kinase inhibitors (like imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib) have IC50 values well below 100 nM against their target kinases.

## Recommended Tools:

- **ChEMBL website** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
- **ChEMBL API** or **Python client**
- **SQL queries** if using downloaded ChEMBL database

Would you like guidance on how to perform this search using any specific method?",,10.73354697227478,62,402,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me create a summary of the findings:

- In 2020: ~2,500-3,000 EM structures deposited that year
- By 2023-2024: Annual deposits were exceeding 4,000-5,000 EM structures per year

Cryo-EM has experienced explosive growth due to technological advances (better detectors, improved software, resolution improvements), making it especially valuable for:
- Large macromolecular complexes
- Membrane proteins
- Structures difficult to crystallize

For the most current and exact number, you would need to query the PDB database directly at rcsb.org, where you can filter structures by experimental method to get real-time statistics.",,8.825398206710815,54,263,True,False,0.0,"Based on the search results from PDBj (Protein Data Bank Japan), there are **33,635 protein structure entries** in the PDB that used electron microscopy as the experimental method.

- Electron cryo-microscopy
- Electron cryomicroscopy

The search results show a diverse range of structures determined by EM, including ribosomal subunits, ion channels, viral proteins (including coronavirus spike proteins), membrane proteins, and various protein complexes.

2. **Search for kinase inhibitors** using target classification filters
3. **Sort by deposition date** or entry date to find the most recent additions
4. **Filter by activity data quality** (e.g., compounds with IC50, Ki, or Kd values)

Alternatively, you could:
- Use the ChEMBL SQL database or RESTful API to query compounds by date
- Check recent ChEMBL release notes, which often highlight newly added datasets
- Look at recent publications that deposited kinase inhibitor data to ChEMBL

| 2015 | 1,438 | 630 | 781 | 43.8% |
| 2016 | 496 | 159 | 325 | 32.1% |
| 2017 | 1,109 | 151 | 945 | 13.6% |
| 2018 | 837 | 20 | 817 | 2.4% |
| 2019 | 2,006 | 139 | 1,856 | 6.9% |
| 2020 | 1,643 | 271 | 1,365 | 16.5% |
| 2021 | 99 | 6 | 93 | 6.1% |
| 2022 | 156 | 92 | 49 | 59.0% |
| 2023 | 215 | 138 | 63 | 64.2% |

### **Key Observations:**

1. **High Variability**: Resistance rates fluctuate significantly year-to-year, ranging from 2.4% (2018) to 64.2% (2023).

2. **Recent Spike**: There's a concerning upward trend in 2022-2023, with resistance rates jumping to **59-64%**, the highest in the entire period.

3. **Mid-Period Peak**: 2014-2015 showed elevated resistance (43-52%), followed by a decline in 2017-2019.

4. **Sample Size Variation**: Testing volume varied considerably, from 99 samples (2021) to 2,006 samples (2019), which may affect year-to-year comparisons.

### **Geographic Distribution (2010-2023):**

| Region | Total Samples | Resistant Isolates | Resistance Rate |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Americas | 7,823 | 957 | 12.2% |
| Europe | 1,989 | 689 | 34.6% |
| Asia | 419 | 239 | 57.0% |
| Africa | 52 | 27 | 51.9% |
| Oceania | 2 | 0 | 0% |

**Regional Insights**: Europe and Asia show notably higher resistance rates (35% and 57% respectively) compared to the Americas (12%), suggesting significant geographic variation in ciprofloxacin resistance patterns.

### **Conclusion:**

While there isn't a simple linear trend, the data reveals concerning patterns: a recent sharp increase in resistance (2022-2023), substantial geographic variation, and overall high resistance rates in certain regions. The data suggests ciprofloxacin resistance in *E. coli* remains a significant and evolving public health concern, particularly in recent years.",,50.56081414222717,26,1942,15293,163561,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__list_databases"", ""input"": {}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?year \n       (COUNT(*) as ?total) \n       (SUM(?isResistant) as ?resistant)\n       (SUM(?isSusceptible) as ?susceptible)\n       (SUM(?isIntermediate) as ?intermediate)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:organism \""Escherichia coli\"" .\n  ?s amr:antibioticName \""ciprofloxacin\"" .\n  ?s amr:collectionYear ?year .\n  ?s amr:resistancePhenotype ?phenotype .\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""resistant\"", 1, 0) as ?isResistant)\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""susceptible\"", 1, 0) as ?isSusceptible)\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""intermediate\"", 1, 0) as ?isIntermediate)\n  FILTER(?year >= 2010 && ?year <= 2023)\n}\nGROUP BY ?year\nORDER BY ?year""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?region (COUNT(*) as ?samples) \n       (SUM(?isResistant) as ?resistant)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:organism \""Escherichia coli\"" .\n  ?s amr:antibioticName \""ciprofloxacin\"" .\n  ?s amr:collectionYear ?year .\n  ?s amr:resistancePhenotype ?phenotype .\n  ?s amr:geographicalRegion ?region .\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""resistant\"", 1, 0) as ?isResistant)\n  FILTER(?year >= 2010 && ?year <= 2023)\n}\nGROUP BY ?region\nORDER BY DESC(?samples)""}}]",CRITICAL,Temporal trend data showing year-by-year resistance rates,"Database: AMR Portal.

34,2026-01-09,Specificity,What evidence type is predominantly used for AMR gene prediction in the AMR Portal?,True,True,False,0.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance) Portal, particularly NCBI's Pathogen Detection system and related AMR resources, predominantly uses **sequence-based evidence** for AMR gene prediction.

More specifically, the primary evidence types include:

1. **Nucleotide sequence similarity** - AMR genes are identified by comparing genomic sequences against curated reference databases of known AMR genes

2. **Reference gene databases** - The system primarily relies on curated databases like:
   - **NCBI's Reference Gene Catalog** for AMR genes
   - Other databases integrated into the analysis pipeline

3. **Hierarchical gene family classification** - Genes are classified into AMR gene families based on sequence homology

The prediction is typically done through:
- **BLAST-based or similar alignment methods** to identify AMR genes in bacterial genomes
- **Threshold-based calling** using sequence identity and coverage cutoffs

This is distinct from phenotypic evidence (actual antimicrobial susceptibility testing results), though some portals may integrate both genotypic predictions and phenotypic data when available.

The genotypic/sequence-based approach allows for rapid, automated prediction of AMR potential directly from genomic sequence data without requiring laboratory culture and susceptibility testing.",,9.607900142669678,54,286,True,True,1.0,"Based on the AMR Portal database documentation, I can answer your question about the evidence types used for AMR gene prediction.

According to the data quality statistics in the AMR Portal:

**HMM (Hidden Markov Model)** is the **predominant evidence type** used for AMR gene prediction in the AMR Portal, accounting for **approximately 65%** of genotype features that have evidence type specified.

This is clearly stated in the documentation under the data quality section:
> ""Evidence type in genotype data predominantly HMM (65% of features with evidence type specified)""

The HMM evidence type is used to identify AMR genes through profile-based sequence analysis. When you look at the genotype data structure, each AMR gene feature includes:
- `amr:evidenceType` - specifying the method (predominantly ""HMM"")
- `amr:evidenceAccession` - the identifier for the HMM model used (e.g., ""NF000263.1"")
- `amr:evidenceDescription` - description of the detected feature
- `amr:evidenceLink` - links to NCBI Pathogen Detection annotation evidence

This approach allows for sensitive and specific detection of AMR genes based on sequence similarity to known resistance determinants, which is why it's the primary method used across the ~1.1 million genotype features in the database.",,19.71547484397888,9,410,10941,52647,mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file,"[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}]",CRITICAL,HMM (Hidden Markov Model),Database: AMR Portal.

Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a summary of the findings:

## Summary of Findings

Based on my search of the AMR Portal database, I found **E. coli isolates from Asia that are resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone**. However, there is an important limitation:

### **Key Finding: No isolates after 2020**

The AMR Portal database does not contain any E. coli isolates from Southeast Asia (or Asia in general) that were collected after 2020 and showed dual resistance to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. The most recent isolates with this resistance profile were collected in **2017**.

### **Isolates Found (2012-2017)**

I identified **46 E. coli isolates from Asia** with confirmed resistance to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone:

#### **By Country/Region:**
1. **Bangladesh** (Southern Asia): 16 isolates (2014-2015)
   - ETEC isolates from enterotoxigenic E. coli studies
   
2. **Pakistan** (Southern Asia): 25 isolates (2012-2017)
   - Multiple clinical isolates (PH series and EC series)
   - Most recent: EC_11 (2017)
   
3. **India** (Southern Asia): 2 isolates (2016)
   - Urinary tract infection isolates
   - One particularly concerning isolate (SAMN11638310) showing **extensive drug resistance** including:
     - Ciprofloxacin: MIC ≥256 μg/mL
     - Ceftriaxone: MIC >128 μg/mL
     - Also resistant to meropenem, colistin, gentamicin, and multiple other antibiotics

4. **China** (Eastern Asia): 1 isolate (2013)
   - CRE1493 from rectal swab
   
5. **Hong Kong** (Eastern Asia): 1 isolate (2014)
   - CRE1540 from rectal swab

### **Notable Resistance Patterns:**

Several isolates showed **multidrug resistance** beyond ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, including resistance to:
- Other fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, levofloxacin)
- Other cephalosporins (cefixime, ceftazidime, cefazolin)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
- Macrolides (azithromycin, erythromycin)
- In severe cases: carbapenems (meropenem) and colistin

### **Data Limitation:**

The AMR Portal's coverage for Southeast Asian E. coli isolates is limited to collections made before 2020. The database shows:
- Thailand: data up to 2016
- Most Southeast Asian countries: no data after 2017

**For data collected after 2020**, you would need to consult other sources such as:
- National AMR surveillance programs
- WHO GLASS (Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System)
- Recent published studies in PubMed
- Regional AMR networks

1. Visit the PDB website (rcsb.org or pdbe.org)
2. Search for entry 5D8V
3. Look in the ""Refinement"" or ""Structure validation"" section of the entry

The R-work value is a measure of how well the refined atomic model fits the experimental X-ray diffraction data, with lower values generally indicating better agreement (typical values for high-resolution structures are often in the range of 0.15-0.25 or 15-25%).

If you let me know what the resolution of 5D8V is or provide the R-work value, I'd be happy to discuss what it means in the context of structure quality!",,6.527106761932373,61,196,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! I found the R-work value for PDB entry 5D8V.

## Answer

The **R-work value for PDB entry 5D8V is 0.072 (7.2%)**.

This is indeed an exceptionally high-resolution structure with:
- **Resolution**: 0.48 Å (one of the highest resolution protein structures ever determined)
- **R-work**: 0.072 (7.2%)
- **R-free**: 0.078 (7.8%)

For context, 5D8V is the ultra-high resolution structure of a high-potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP). The very low R-work value (7.2%) indicates excellent agreement between the crystallographic model and the experimental X-ray diffraction data, which is typical for such ultra-high resolution structures. The small gap between R-work and R-free (0.6%) also suggests the model is not overfitted.",,70.86638593673706,42,2216,14135,259290,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_example, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbx: <http://pdbj.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX pdbo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nWHERE {\n  ?refine a pdbo:pdbx_refine ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?reflns a pdbo:refln ;\n           pdbo:refln.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n           pdbo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n  }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?property ?value\nWHERE {\n  ?refine a pdbo:pdbx_refine ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         ?property ?value .\n}\nLIMIT 100\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""5D8V"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX PDBo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nWHERE {\n  ?s a PDBo:pdbx_refineType ;\n     PDBo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n     PDBo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?s PDBo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?ref a PDBo:reflnType ;\n         PDBo:refln.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         PDBo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n  }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_example"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbo: <https://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/pdbj>\nWHERE {\n    ?PDB a pdbo:datablock ;\n        dct:identifier \""5D8V\"" ;\n        pdbo:has_pdbx_refineCategory / pdbo:has_pdbx_refine ?refine .\n    \n    ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n    \n    OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n    \n    OPTIONAL {\n        ?PDB pdbo:has_reflnCategory / pdbo:has_refln ?reflnObj .\n        ?reflnObj pdbo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n    }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbx: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/pdbj>\nWHERE {\n  ?entry a pdbx:datablock .\n  BIND(STRAFTER(str(?entry), \""http://rdf.wwpdb.org/pdb/\"") AS ?entry_id)\n  FILTER(?entry_id = \""5D8V\"")\n  \n  ?entry pdbx:has_refineCategory/pdbx:has_refine ?refine .\n  \n  ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_d_res_high ?resolution }\n}\n""}}]",CRITICAL,0.072,Database: PDB.

38,2026-01-09,Precision,What is the EC number for protein tyrosine kinases in Reactome?,True,False,True,1.0,"I don't have specific information about the exact EC number for protein tyrosine kinases as catalogued in Reactome in my training knowledge.

However, I can tell you that protein tyrosine kinases generally fall under **EC 2.7.10.-** in the Enzyme Commission classification system:

- **EC 2.7.10.1** refers to receptor protein tyrosine kinases
- **EC 2.7.10.2** refers to non-specific protein tyrosine kinases (non-receptor tyrosine kinases)

Reactome likely uses these standard EC classifications when annotating protein tyrosine kinases in their pathway database, but the specific EC number used would depend on which particular tyrosine kinase or group of kinases you're interested in. Reactome may also use more specific EC numbers for individual, well-characterized kinases.

To get the precise EC number as it appears in Reactome, you would need to consult the Reactome database directly.",,6.544149160385132,54,221,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide the answer to the user.

Based on my search of the Reactome database, **protein tyrosine kinases** are associated with two main EC numbers:

## **EC 2.7.10.1** - Receptor protein tyrosine kinase
- Found in **290 reactions** in Reactome
- Examples include:
  - JAK family kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2)
  - Reactions like ""JAK3 is phosphorylated after IL15 stimulation""
  - IL-receptor associated phosphorylation events
  - STAT protein phosphorylation by JAKs

## **EC 2.7.10.2** - Non-specific protein tyrosine kinase
- Found in **2,094 reactions** in Reactome (much more abundant)
- Examples include:
  - SRC family kinases (SRC, LYN, FYN, FRK)
  - PTK2 (FAK - Focal Adhesion Kinase)
  - SYK (Spleen tyrosine kinase)
  - Reactions like ""Autophosphorylation of SRC"" and ""PTK2 autophosphorylates downstream of EGFR""

The distinction between these two EC numbers is:

### 1. **ChEMBL Web Interface**
- Go to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/
- Use the advanced search to filter by:
  - Target containing ""kinase"" but NOT ""tyrosine""
  - Bioactivity IC50 < 10 nM

### 2. **ChEMBL API or SQL queries**
You could use Python with the ChEMBL web services:

```python
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client

# Search for targets
target = new_client.target
targets = target.filter(target_synonym__icontains='kinase')
# Then filter out tyrosine kinases programmatically

# Search for activities
activity = new_client.activity
activities = activity.filter(
    standard_type='IC50',
    standard_value__lte=10,
    standard_units='nM'
)
```

### 3. **Expected Results**
This search would likely return inhibitors of:
- Serine/threonine kinases (like CDKs, MAPKs, Aurora kinases)
- Lipid kinases (like PI3K)
- Other non-tyrosine kinases

Would you like guidance on how to set up such a query, or do you have access to ChEMBL data that you'd like help interpreting?",,10.3246750831604,72,396,True,True,1.0,"Excellent! Now I have comprehensive results. Let me create a summary of the findings:

## General Trends (based on training data):

1. **Increasing Resistance**: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has been showing concerning upward trends globally, particularly in healthcare settings.

2. **Geographic Variation**: Higher resistance rates have been reported in:
   - Mediterranean countries (Greece, Italy)
   - Parts of Asia (India, China)
   - Latin America
   - Some regions of the United States

3. **Resistance Mechanisms**: The spread is primarily driven by:
   - Carbapenemase-producing enzymes (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM)
   - KPC enzymes being particularly common in certain regions

4. **Resistance Rates**: Some regions reported resistance rates ranging from <1% to >50%, depending on the location and healthcare setting.

**For current, specific data**, I recommend:
- Visiting the WHO AMR Portal directly (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/antimicrobial-resistance)
- Checking your regional surveillance network
- Consulting CDC or ECDC reports for recent data

| Doripenem | 1 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Finding:** Imipenem shows the highest resistance rate at 80%, followed by meropenem at 36%.

### **Geographic Distribution (2020-2025)**

Countries with highest carbapenem resistance rates (minimum 10 samples):

| Country | Tests | Resistant | Resistance Rate |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Italy** | 12 | 12 | **100%** |
| **Ireland** | 12 | 12 | **100%** |
| **Tunisia** | 44 | 41 | **93%** |
| **Brazil** | 63 | 54 | **86%** |
| **India** | 27 | 22 | **81%** |
| USA | 248 | 29 | 12% |
| Canada | 15 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Finding:** Mediterranean countries (Italy, Tunisia) and emerging economies (Brazil, India) show critically high resistance rates.

### **Genetic Mechanisms**

The most prevalent beta-lactamase genes in carbapenem-resistant *K. pneumoniae* isolates include:

**Carbapenemase Genes (2020-2025):**
- **NDM-1 variants**: The dominant carbapenemase detected
  - blaNDM-1_1: 42 isolates
  - blaNDM-1_2: 42 isolates
  - blaNDM-1: 15 isolates
  
- Other carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, IMP, VIM): Rarely detected in this dataset

**Other Beta-Lactamase Genes:**
- Generic bla genes (bla_1 through bla_18): Highly prevalent across isolates
- ompC (outer membrane porin): 512 isolates
- ampC variants: Present in carbapenem-resistant strains

### **Clinical Implications**

1. **High resistance rates** in several regions indicate carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) is a major clinical challenge
2. **NDM-1 predominance** suggests metallo-beta-lactamase-mediated resistance is the primary mechanism
3. **Geographic clustering** in Mediterranean and South Asian regions aligns with known epidemiology
4. **Variable resistance by agent** suggests imipenem may be less effective than other carbapenems in tested populations

## Characteristics of Sub-1.0 Å Resolution Structures

Structures with resolution better than 1.0 Å (< 1.0 Å) are extremely rare and represent the highest quality X-ray crystallographic data. At this resolution:
- Individual atoms can be clearly resolved
- Hydrogen atoms may be visible
- Alternative conformations are well-defined
- Bond lengths and angles are very precisely determined

## Known Examples (from my training data):

Some notable structures that have achieved sub-1.0 Å resolution include:

1. **Crambin** - One of the first proteins to break the 1.0 Å barrier (achieved ~0.54 Å in some studies)

2. **Small proteins and peptides** - These are most common in this resolution range due to:
   - Better crystallization properties
   - Less conformational heterogeneity
   - Smaller unit cells

3. **Aldose reductase** - Has structures refined to ~0.66 Å

4. **Some enzymes complexes** with small molecules/inhibitors

## Important Notes:

- As of my training data, there were likely only a few dozen structures in the PDB with resolution better than 1.0 Å
- Most are small proteins (< 150 residues)
- This represents a tiny fraction of the total PDB entries

## Clinical Significance:
**Pathogenic** - This variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

## Key Details:

**Molecular consequence:** This is a frameshift variant (also designated as c.2244dupA or p.Glu749Ter) that results from a duplication of a single nucleotide in exon 11 of BRCA1. The frameshift leads to a premature stop codon.

**Cancer risks:** Carriers of this pathogenic BRCA1 variant have significantly increased lifetime risks for:
- **Breast cancer**: Up to 70-80% lifetime risk
- **Ovarian cancer**: Up to 40-50% lifetime risk
- Also increased risks for other cancers including pancreatic cancer

**Clinical actionability:** This variant has important implications for:
- Cancer screening and surveillance protocols
- Prophylactic surgery options (mastectomy, oophorectomy)
- Treatment decisions (PARP inhibitors for BRCA1-associated cancers)
- Family testing and genetic counseling

**Population:** This variant has been reported in multiple families and populations with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

Individuals found to carry this variant should receive genetic counseling and be offered enhanced cancer surveillance and risk-reduction strategies according to established guidelines for BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers.",,10.168195962905884,60,336,True,True,1.0,"Based on the ClinVar data, I found information about the BRCA1 variant c.2244dup.

## **BRCA1 c.2244dup (p.Asp749fs) - Clinical Significance**

### **Classification: Pathogenic**

**Key Details:**
- **ClinVar Accession:** VCV000856461
- **Variant Type:** Duplication (frameshift)
- **Protein Change:** p.Asp749fs (aspartate 749 frameshift)
- **Genomic Location:** 
  - GRCh38: Chr 17:43093286-43093287
  - GRCh37: Chr 17:41245303-41245304

### **Clinical Information:**

- **Associated Condition:** Hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)
- **Review Status:** Criteria provided, single submitter
- **Last Evaluated:** March 13, 2019
- **Molecular Consequence:** Frameshift variant (also affects intron variant)

### **Clinical Significance:**

This variant is classified as **Pathogenic** for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The duplication of a single nucleotide causes a frameshift mutation that disrupts the normal reading frame of the BRCA1 gene, leading to a truncated or non-functional protein. BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene, and loss of function mutations significantly increase the risk of:

- Breast cancer (especially early-onset)
- Ovarian cancer
- Other BRCA1-associated cancers

Individuals carrying this variant should receive appropriate genetic counseling and may benefit from enhanced surveillance or risk-reducing interventions according to clinical guidelines.

## Approach to Find Human Kinases with ChEMBL Bioactivity Data

**General Strategy:**

1. **UniProt Query for Human Kinases:**
   - Search UniProt for: `(organism:""Homo sapiens"" [9606]) AND (protein_name:kinase OR ec:2.7.*)`
   - EC 2.7.* covers transferases (kinases transfer phosphate groups)
   - Alternatively, use Gene Ontology terms: `GO:0016301` (kinase activity)

2. **Cross-reference with ChEMBL:**
   - Look for UniProt entries with ChEMBL cross-references
   - In UniProt, this appears in the ""Cross-references"" section

**Key Information:**

- **Human kinases**: There are approximately **518 human protein kinases** in the human kinome
- Many of these are well-studied drug targets with extensive bioactivity data in ChEMBL
- Major kinase families include: tyrosine kinases (TKs), serine/threonine kinases (STKs), lipid kinases, etc.

**Well-Known Examples with Abundant ChEMBL Data:**
- EGFR (P00533)
- BRAF (P15056)
- CDK2 (P24941)
- ABL1 (P00519)
- MAPK1/ERK2 (P28482)

**To get the complete list**, you would need to:
1. Download human kinase data from UniProt
2. Filter for entries with ChEMBL database cross-references
3. Verify bioactivity data exists in ChEMBL for each target

Would you like specific guidance on using UniProt's API or specific search syntax?",,11.929579019546509,59,461,True,False,0.4,"Excellent! Now let me compile a comprehensive summary.

## ClinVar Clinical Significance Categories

ClinVar uses the following main clinical significance categories:

1. **Pathogenic** - Variants that cause disease
2. **Likely pathogenic** - Strong evidence suggesting disease causation
3. **Benign** - Variants that do not cause disease
4. **Likely benign** - Strong evidence suggesting no disease causation
5. **Uncertain significance (VUS)** - Insufficient evidence to classify
6. **Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity** - Different submitters disagree
7. **Risk factor** - Variants that increase disease risk
8. **Drug response** - Variants affecting medication response
9. **Other** - Various other categories
10. **Not provided** - No classification submitted

## Approximate Distribution (from my training data)

Based on historical data, the general distribution trends were:

- **Uncertain significance**: Typically the largest category (~40-50%)
- **Benign/Likely benign**: Combined ~30-40%
- **Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic**: Combined ~15-20%
- **Other categories**: Smaller percentages

**Important note**: ClinVar is continuously updated with new submissions and reclassifications, so these numbers change regularly.

**General Information:**

1. **ChEMBL** and **DrugBank** are complementary but separate databases:
   - ChEMBL is a bioactivity database maintained by EMBL-EBI
   - DrugBank is a comprehensive drug and drug target database

2. **Cross-references exist** between these databases - many ChEMBL entries for approved drugs include DrugBank IDs as cross-references.

3. **Approved drugs in ChEMBL** are typically marked with `max_phase = 4` in their database.

To find DrugBank IDs for ChEMBL approved drugs, you would need to:
- Query ChEMBL for molecules with `max_phase = 4` (approved status)
- Extract the DrugBank cross-references from those entries

2. **Data Concentration**: According to the database documentation, while the temporal range extends from 1911 to 2025, the data is concentrated in recent decades. About **85% of phenotypic measurements include temporal data** (collection year information).

3. **Data Sources**: The temporal data comes from multiple integrated sources:
   - NCBI Pathogen Detection
   - PATRIC
   - CABBAGE (published literature data from PubMed)

4. **Coverage**: With approximately 1.7 million phenotypic measurements in the database, this represents a substantial longitudinal dataset for tracking antimicrobial resistance trends over time, particularly valuable for temporal trend analysis of resistance patterns.

2. **Categorical interpretations** - Susceptible (S), Intermediate (I), Resistant (R)
3. **Qualitative results** - positive/negative or presence/absence

- The testing method used (automated systems, broth microdilution, disk diffusion)
- Data collection standards and requirements

## Answer

**Approximately 75.8% of AMR Portal phenotypes have quantitative MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) measurements.**

### Detailed Statistics:

- **Total phenotype measurements**: 1,714,486
- **Phenotypes with MIC measurements**: 1,299,368
- **Percentage**: **75.8%**

### MIC Measurement Sign Distribution:

The quantitative MIC measurements use various comparison operators to indicate the relationship between measured and actual values:

| Measurement Sign | Count | Percentage of MIC data |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------|
| ≤ | 432,997 | 33.3% |
| == | 401,615 | 30.9% |
| = | 258,571 | 19.9% |
| > | 162,417 | 12.5% |
| ≥ | 28,436 | 2.2% |
| < | 9,994 | 0.8% |
| >,< | 5,338 | 0.4% |

The presence of inequality signs (≤, >, ≥, <) indicates cases where the actual MIC value exceeded the testing range limits, which is common in clinical microbiology when dilution series have upper or lower boundaries.

This high percentage (75.8%) of quantitative MIC data makes the AMR Portal particularly valuable for dose-response analysis and quantitative antimicrobial resistance studies, as opposed to databases that only contain qualitative susceptibility classifications (resistant/susceptible/intermediate).",,34.55555081367493,21,966,11549,127181,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) as ?totalPhenotypes)\n  (SUM(IF(BOUND(?micValue), 1, 0)) as ?phenotypesWithMIC)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  OPTIONAL { ?s amr:measurementValue ?micValue . }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT \n  ?measurementSign \n  (COUNT(*) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:measurementValue ?micValue .\n  ?s amr:measurementSign ?measurementSign .\n}\nGROUP BY ?measurementSign\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n""}}]",CRITICAL,~30%,Database: AMR Portal.

## What I can tell you:

**Signal peptides** are short amino acid sequences (typically 15-30 residues) at the N-terminus of proteins that direct them to the secretory pathway. They're cleaved off after the protein crosses the membrane.

**UniProt reviewed proteins** (Swiss-Prot entries) that contain signal peptides are extremely numerous and include:

### Major protein categories:
1. **Secreted proteins** - hormones, cytokines, antibodies
2. **Membrane proteins** - receptors, channels, transporters
3. **Lysosomal proteins**
4. **Proteins destined for organelles** in the secretory pathway

### Examples of well-known proteins with signal peptides:
- Insulin
- Immunoglobulins (antibodies)
- Serum albumin
- Many cytokines and growth factors
- Extracellular matrix proteins

### Scale:
Signal peptides are found in approximately **15-30% of all proteins** across different organisms, so in UniProt/Swiss-Prot (which contains over 500,000 reviewed entries), this would represent tens of thousands of proteins.

**To get the actual current list**, you would need to:

## How to Search for Compounds with Both ChEBI and SNOMED CT Classifications:

### Using PubChem's Web Interface:
1. Go to PubChem (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
2. Use the Advanced Search feature
3. Search for compounds that have cross-references to both:
   - **ChEBI** (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest)
   - **SNOMED CT** (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms)

## Answer

There are **47 distinct AMR gene classes** represented in the AMR Portal genotype data.

These classes cover a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, with the most prevalent being:

### Top 10 AMR Gene Classes (by frequency):
1. **BETA-LACTAM** - 243,389 genes
2. **AMINOGLYCOSIDE** - 187,430 genes
3. **EFFLUX** - 180,406 genes
4. **TETRACYCLINE** - 89,420 genes

8. **FOSFOMYCIN** - 41,716 genes
9. **PHENICOL/QUINOLONE** - 29,342 genes
10. **PHENICOL** - 28,784 genes

### Key Observations:
- Many classes represent **single antibiotic families** (e.g., BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE)
- Some classes represent **multiple drug families** combined with slashes (e.g., LINCOSAMIDE/MACROLIDE/STREPTOGRAMIN), indicating genes that confer resistance to multiple antibiotic classes
- The most common resistance genes target **beta-lactam antibiotics**, followed by aminoglycosides and efflux pumps

However, I can tell you about the general relationship:

**How MONDO and ClinVar are connected:**

1. **ClinVar** contains clinical variants with disease associations, often using multiple disease naming systems and ontologies

2. **MONDO** is a disease ontology that integrates and harmonizes disease concepts from multiple sources including:
   - OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)
   - Orphanet
   - DOID (Disease Ontology)
   - Others

3. **The connection**: ClinVar variants are often annotated with disease names and identifiers that can be mapped to MONDO terms. This typically happens through:
   - Direct MONDO term annotations
   - Mapping from OMIM IDs (which ClinVar commonly uses)
   - Cross-references through other disease databases

**Types of MONDO terms you'd find:**
- Genetic diseases (the vast majority)
- Mendelian disorders
- Cancer predisposition syndromes
- Rare diseases

91,2026-01-09,Currency,What mRNA vaccine-related structures have been deposited in PDB since 2020?,True,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on my training knowledge, several mRNA vaccine-related structures have been deposited in the PDB since 2020, primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that are the targets of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines:

## Key Structure Categories:

**1. Spike Protein Structures:**
- Prefusion-stabilized spike proteins (the immunogen in mRNA vaccines)
- Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes
- Spike proteins with mutations from variants of concern
- Structures showing spike in complex with antibodies elicited by vaccination

**2. Spike-Antibody Complexes:**
- Neutralizing antibodies from vaccinated individuals bound to spike/RBD
- These help explain vaccine efficacy and immune response

**3. Variant Structures:**
- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron variant spike proteins
- These structures helped understand immune evasion and vaccine effectiveness against variants

## Notable Examples Include:
- Structures showing the S-2P stabilization mutations (K986P, V987P) used in both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines
- Cryo-EM structures of full-length spike trimers
- Crystal structures of RBD-antibody complexes

The mRNA vaccines encode the spike protein itself, so these structural studies of the spike protein and immune responses to it are directly relevant to understanding mRNA vaccine mechanisms, though structures of the mRNA delivery systems (lipid nanoparticles) or mRNA itself are not typically deposited in the PDB.

Would you like more specific PDB IDs or details about particular structures?",,10.952719926834106,56,373,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on my search of the PDB database, here are the key **mRNA vaccine-related structures deposited since 2020**:

## Direct mRNA Vaccine Structures

### 1. **COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Spike Proteins**
- **7XOG & 7XOE**: Cryo-EM structures of the S glycoprotein encoded by COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidate RQ3013 (both postfusion and prefusion states)
- **8VIA**: Structure showing protective effects of human non-neutralizing cross-reactive spike antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination

### 2. **Modified RNA Structures**
- **8PFK & 8PFQ**: Crystal structures of RNA containing **1-methylpseudouridine** (the modified nucleoside used in Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to reduce immunogenicity and increase stability)

### 3. **Antibody Responses from mRNA Vaccination**
- **9CCI & 9CCJ**: Structures dissecting human monoclonal antibody responses from mRNA and protein-based booster vaccinations against XBB1.5 SARS-CoV-2 variant
- **7FJN, 7FJO, 7FJS**: Structures of spike glycoproteins in complex with antibodies targeting variants like B.1.351 (South African variant)

## Related SARS-CoV-2 Spike Structures (Vaccine Targets)

The database contains **113 total structures** related to mRNA vaccines, with many showing:
- Pre-fusion stabilized spike proteins (the target antigen in mRNA vaccines)
- Antibody-spike complexes from vaccinated individuals
- Variant spike proteins (Delta, Omicron subvariants)
- Receptor binding domain (RBD) structures

## Significance

These structures have been crucial for:
1. **Vaccine design optimization** - understanding spike protein stabilization
2. **Modified nucleoside incorporation** - visualizing how 1-methylpseudouridine affects RNA structure
3. **Antibody response characterization** - mapping epitopes targeted by vaccine-induced immunity
4. **Variant surveillance** - guiding booster vaccine updates

Historically:

- **REFMAC5** (from the CCP4 suite) has been one of the most widely used refinement programs, particularly popular in the structural biology community for many years.

- **PHENIX** (particularly phenix.refine) has become increasingly popular and is now one of the most commonly used packages, especially in more recent depositions.

- **CNS** (Crystallography & NMR System) and its predecessor **X-PLOR** were very commonly used in earlier decades but have declined in usage.

- **SHELXL** has been widely used, particularly for small molecule crystallography and also for some macromolecular structures.

- **BUSTER** is another commercial refinement program that has significant usage.

The relative popularity has shifted over time, with PHENIX gaining substantial market share in recent years due to its comprehensive automation and integration of multiple tools. However, REFMAC5 has maintained strong usage throughout, particularly in European crystallography centers.

However, I can explain how you would approach finding this information:

## How to Find mecA+ MRSA Isolates in the AMR Portal

To identify **Staphylococcus aureus** isolates that have both:
1. **mecA gene** (genotypic resistance)
2. **Methicillin resistance phenotype** (phenotypic resistance)

### Typical Approach in AMR Portal:

1. **Navigate to the NCBI Pathogen Detection/AMR Portal**
   - Go to the Isolate Browser or AMR finder section

2. **Apply Filters:**
   - **Organism**: Staphylococcus aureus
   - **AMR Genotype**: mecA (or mecA gene family)
   - **AMR Phenotype**: Methicillin-resistant or Oxacillin-resistant

3. **Search Parameters:**
   - Look for concordance between genotype and phenotype
   - Filter by BioSample to ensure both data types are from the same isolate

### Key Points:

- **mecA gene** encodes altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) conferring methicillin resistance
- Phenotypic testing typically uses **oxacillin** or **cefoxitin** as surrogate markers
- True MRSA should show both genotypic (mecA+) and phenotypic resistance

### Note:
Without direct database access, I cannot provide you with specific BioSample IDs or isolate counts. You would need to perform this query directly in the NCBI Pathogen Detection portal or AMRFinderPlus databases.

Would you like guidance on interpreting such results once obtained?",,11.034518003463743,75,419,True,True,1.0,"## Summary of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates with mecA Gene AND Methicillin Resistance Phenotype

I successfully identified **3,002 unique Staphylococcus aureus isolates** from the AMR Portal that have BOTH:
1. **Genotypic evidence**: mecA gene detection
2. **Phenotypic evidence**: Methicillin resistance (tested with methicillin, oxacillin, or cefoxitin)

### Key Findings:

#### **By Antibiotic Tested:**
- **Methicillin**: 1,684 isolates
- **Cefoxitin**: 893 isolates  
- **Oxacillin**: 549 isolates

#### **Top Geographic Locations:**
1. **United Kingdom**: 1,454 isolates
   - mecA_1: 587 isolates
   - mecA_2: 501 isolates
   - mecA_3: 366 isolates
2. **Netherlands**: 382 isolates (mostly mecA_2)

4. **China**: 147 isolates
5. **Brazil**: 95 isolates
6. **Germany**: 83 isolates
7. **Turkey**: 52 isolates
8. **Spain**: 42 isolates

#### **mecA Gene Variants:**
The data shows multiple mecA variants (mecA_1, mecA_2, mecA_3, mecA_4), which likely represent different alleles or sequence variants of the mecA gene responsible for methicillin resistance in MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

#### **Sample Data:**
The first 100 results show isolates from various countries collected between 1990-2014, with detailed BioSample identifiers that can be used for further investigation of genomic sequences, metadata, and associated publications.

These isolates represent confirmed MRSA cases where both the genetic mechanism (mecA gene) and the clinical resistance phenotype have been documented in the same sample, making them ideal for genotype-phenotype correlation studies.",,74.35016012191772,31,2690,19347,221448,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?bioSample ?isolateId ?country ?collectionYear ?geneSymbol ?antibiotic ?phenotype\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  #

However, I can tell you that reactions involving both ATP and ADP as participants are quite common in biochemistry and typically include:

1. **Adenylate kinase reactions** - These catalyze the interconversion: 2 ADP ⟷ ATP + AMP, so both ATP and ADP participate.

2. **Coupled phosphorylation reactions** - Where ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP) is coupled to another phosphorylation reaction that might regenerate ATP.

3. **Complex multi-step enzymatic reactions** - Where ATP is consumed in one step and ADP is either a product or a substrate in another step of the same overall reaction.

4. **Nucleoside diphosphate kinase reactions** - These can involve ATP donating a phosphate to produce ADP, while another nucleoside diphosphate accepts it.

I found many Rhea reactions that involve both ATP and ADP. From the search results, I can see numerous biochemical reactions where ATP is consumed and ADP is produced as a product. Let me provide you with a summary of the types of reactions:

## Rhea Reactions Involving Both ATP and ADP

Based on the search results, I found **at least 97 reactions** where both ATP and ADP are participants. These reactions fall into several categories:

### 1. **ATP-driven Transport Reactions (ABC Transporters and P-type ATPases)**
These use ATP hydrolysis to transport ions and molecules across membranes, producing ADP:
- **Ion pumps**: K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cu⁺/Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe³⁺, Cd²⁺, Ag⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺
  - Example: **RHEA:18353** - K⁺/Na⁺ ATPase: `K⁺(out) + Na⁺(in) + ATP + H2O = K⁺(in) + Na⁺(out) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`
  
- **Anion transporters**: sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, molybdate, tungstate, thiosulfate, arsenite
  - Example: **RHEA:10192** - Sulfate transport: `sulfate(out) + ATP + H2O = sulfate(in) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

- **Nutrient transporters**: amino acids, sugars (maltose, galactose, xylose, ribose, arabinose, allose), glycerol-3-phosphate
  - Example: **RHEA:29895** - Glutamine transport: `L-glutamine(out) + ATP + H2O = L-glutamine(in) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

- **Specialized transporters**: bile salts, peptides, lipids, heme, vitamin B1, antibiotics

### 2. **Phosphorylation Reactions**
ATP phosphorylates substrates, producing ADP:
- **RHEA:10272** - Diacylglycerol kinase: `a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol + ATP = a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate + ADP + H⁺`
- **RHEA:15669** - DNA 5'-end phosphorylation: `a 5'-end dephospho-2'-deoxyribonucleoside-DNA + ATP = a 5'-end 5'-phospho-2'-deoxyribonucleoside-DNA + ADP + H⁺`
- **RHEA:54580** - RNA 5'-end phosphorylation: `a 5'-end dephospho-ribonucleoside-RNA + ATP = a 5'-end 5'-phospho-ribonucleoside-RNA + ADP + H⁺`

### 3. **Nucleotide Kinase Reactions**
Transfer of phosphate between nucleotides:
- **RHEA:23100**: `dAMP + ATP = dADP + ADP`
- **RHEA:25094**: `dCMP + ATP = dCDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:12697**: `dGMP + ATP = dGDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:13517**: `dTMP + ATP = dTDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:30655**: `dUMP + ATP = dUDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:11216**: `a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-phosphate + ATP = a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate + ADP`

### 4. **Proton Pumps**
- **RHEA:20852**: `ATP + H2O + H⁺(in) = ADP + phosphate + 2 H⁺(out)`
- **RHEA:57720**: `ATP + H2O + 4 H⁺(in) = ADP + phosphate + 5 H⁺(out)`

### 5. **Nucleotide/Nucleoside Exchange**
- **RHEA:34999** - ADP/ATP antiporter: `ADP(in) + ATP(out) = ADP(out) + ATP(in)`

### 6. **Other ATP Hydrolysis Reactions**
- **RHEA:13065** - Simple ATP hydrolysis: `ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate + H⁺`
- **RHEA:18617** - PEP carboxykinase: `oxaloacetate + ATP = phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP + CO2`
- **RHEA:10348** - 5-oxoprolinase: `5-oxo-L-proline + ATP + 2 H2O = L-glutamate + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

### Common Pattern:
Most of these reactions follow the general pattern of **ATP hydrolysis coupled to work**:
```
ATP + H2O → ADP + phosphate + H⁺
```

The energy released from breaking the high-energy phosphate bond in ATP is used to drive energetically unfavorable processes like active transport, phosphorylation, or biosynthesis.

103,2026-01-09,Currency,What percentage of NANDO diseases currently have MONDO mappings?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have specific, current statistics about the percentage of NANDO (Nanbyo Disease Ontology) diseases that have MONDO (Monarch Disease Ontology) mappings in my training knowledge.

However, I can provide some context: NANDO is a Japanese disease ontology focused on rare and intractable diseases (nanbyo), and MONDO is a global disease ontology that aims to integrate and harmonize disease classifications from multiple sources. There have been ongoing efforts to map NANDO to MONDO to improve interoperability between Japanese and international disease databases.

To get the current percentage, you would need to:
1. Query the latest versions of both ontologies
2. Check mapping files or cross-references between NANDO and MONDO
3. Review recent publications or documentation from the NANDO or MONDO projects

The percentage likely changes over time as both ontologies evolve and mapping efforts continue.",,6.991398334503174,51,201,True,False,0.0,"Based on the SPARQL queries I just ran on the NANDO database:

**Answer: Approximately 77.4% of NANDO diseases currently have MONDO mappings.**

Here are the specific numbers:
- **Total NANDO diseases**: 2,777
- **NANDO diseases with MONDO mappings**: 2,150
- **Percentage**: 2,150 / 2,777 = **77.4%**

2. **Sequence alignment** - Comparing query sequences against reference AMR genes using tools like BLAST

3. **Identity thresholds** - Typically requiring high sequence identity (often >80-90%) and coverage to confidently annotate a gene as an AMR determinant

Additional evidence types that may be integrated include:

- **Functional domains** - Presence of conserved protein domains associated with resistance mechanisms
- **Experimental validation** - Literature-based evidence of resistance phenotypes
- **Genomic context** - Location on mobile genetic elements or proximity to other resistance genes

## How to Search ClinVar for BRCA1 Pathogenic Variants:

**On the ClinVar website (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/):**

1. **Basic search approach:**
   - Search for: `BRCA1[gene] AND (pathogenic[clin] OR likely pathogenic[clin])`
   - Then filter by ""Last Updated"" date to show only entries updated after 2024

2. **Advanced search filters:**
   - Gene: BRCA1
   - Clinical significance: Select ""Pathogenic"" and ""Likely pathogenic""
   - Last evaluated/updated: After January 1, 2024

3. **Alternative using the API or download:**
   - Download the ClinVar variant summary file
   - Filter programmatically for BRCA1 variants with the desired classification and update dates

## What you would typically find:

BRCA1 pathogenic variants are commonly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The database typically contains hundreds to thousands of such variants, including:
- Frameshift mutations
- Nonsense mutations
- Splice site variants
- Missense variants in critical domains

Key aspects of the notification number system:

1. **Unique Identifier**: Each notified body receives a unique four-digit identification number when it is notified by an EU member state or country participating in the relevant EU legislation.

2. **Traceability**: The number allows for clear identification and traceability of which notified body has assessed and certified a product's conformity with applicable EU directives or regulations.

3. **CE Marking**: When a notified body is involved in the conformity assessment process, its notification number must be affixed to the product alongside the CE marking, indicating third-party certification was required and performed.

4. **Public Database**: The NANDO database uses these numbers to maintain publicly accessible information about each notified body, including their scope of authorization, applicable legislation, and current status.

5. **Official Recognition**: The notification number represents official recognition by the notifying authority that the body meets the requirements to perform specific conformity assessment procedures.

1. **Government Designation**: Notification numbers (accessed via the property `nando:hasNotificationNumber`) are assigned to diseases officially designated by the Japanese government as intractable diseases requiring special support.

2. **Coverage**: Approximately **88% of diseases in NANDO** (about 2,454 out of 2,777 total diseases) have notification numbers, indicating they are designated for government assistance.

3. **Administrative Function**: These numbers serve as official identifiers in Japan's healthcare policy and patient information systems for:
   - Tracking diseases eligible for government subsidies
   - Coordinating research efforts
   - Managing patient support programs
   - Administrative documentation

## Example

For instance, **Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy** (Kennedy disease) has notification number **""1""**, while **Parkinson's disease** has notification number **""6""**. These numbers are used in official government documentation and healthcare systems to reference these conditions.

## Key Observations:

1. **Clinical specimens dominate**: The most common sources are human clinical samples including stool (189,939), urine (123,939), blood (81,333), and sputum (55,428).

2. **Food sources are well-represented**: There's substantial representation of food animal products, particularly poultry (chicken, turkey) and meat (beef, pork), reflecting food safety surveillance.

3. **Data quality issues**: There are inconsistencies in capitalization (e.g., ""Stool"" vs ""stool"", ""Blood"" vs ""blood""), which affects the counts. If normalized, the numbers would be even higher for the major categories.

4. **Veterinary samples**: Many samples are from domestic animals, particularly dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and farm animals (swine, cattle).

5. **Diverse sample types**: The database contains over 1,000 different isolation source entries, ranging from clinical specimens to food products, environmental samples, and veterinary sources.

The total includes specimens from over 1.7 million phenotypic AMR measurements, making this a comprehensive antimicrobial resistance surveillance database spanning clinical, veterinary, and food safety domains.",,55.99620604515076,26,1870,43253,155245,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nSELECT ?isolation_source (COUNT(?sample) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?sample a <http://purl.jp/bio/11/amrportal/AMRSample> ;\n          <http://purl.jp/bio/11/amrportal/isolation_source> ?isolation_source .\n}\nGROUP BY ?isolation_source\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?isolationSource (COUNT(*) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:isolationSource ?isolationSource .\n}\nGROUP BY ?isolationSource\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 100""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?isolationSource (COUNT(*) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:isolationSource ?isolationSource .\n}\nGROUP BY ?isolationSource\nORDER BY DESC(?count)""}}]",CRITICAL,"Stool (189,939), urine (123,939), blood (81,333), sputum (55,428), etc.",Database: AMR Portal.

## Approach to Find These Structures:

### 1. **Using PDB Website (rcsb.org)**
You can use the advanced search with these criteria:
- **Experimental Method**: Electron Microscopy (EM)
- **Has EMDB ID**: Yes (this ensures an EMDB entry exists)
- **Has PubMed ID**: Yes (this ensures a publication exists)

### 2. **General Information**

Most cryo-EM structures deposited in the PDB will have:
- An associated EMDB entry (with the density map)
- A primary citation with a PubMed ID

This represents the majority of cryo-EM structures, as publication is typically required or expected for deposition.

### 3. **Key Fields to Check**
When viewing a PDB entry, look for:
- **EMDB ID**: Usually formatted as EMD-XXXXX
- **Primary Citation**: With DOI and PubMed ID (PMID)

### 4. **Approximate Numbers**
As of my training data, there are tens of thousands of cryo-EM structures in the PDB, and the vast majority have both EMDB maps and publications. The exact current number would require a database query.

### 5. **Example Structures** (that I know meet these criteria):
- **7BV2** - SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
- **6VSB** - SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  
- **3J9I** - Ribosome structures

Would you like help with a more specific subset of these structures?",,12.363340854644775,63,394,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! I've found many PDB structures with both cryo-EM density maps in EMDB and publications in PubMed. Here's a comprehensive summary:

## Most Frequently Cited Publications in the AMR Portal from 2024 Onwards

Unfortunately, **there are no publications from 2024 onwards** among the most frequently cited papers in the AMR Portal database. The database primarily references publications from earlier years (2018-2023), which reflects the typical lag time between research publication, data collection, and database integration.

However, I can identify the **most recently published highly-cited papers** (from 2023) in the AMR Portal:

### Top Publication from 2023:

1. **PMID: 38052776** - **108,358 citations in AMR Portal**
   - **Title:** ""National genomic surveillance integrating standardized quantitative susceptibility testing clarifies antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacterales""
   - **Journal:** Nature Communications
   - **Published:** December 5, 2023
   - **Focus:** Genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 4,195 isolates of *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in Japan. The study provides a blueprint for national genomic surveillance integrating standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

### Other Notable Highly-Cited Publications from 2022-2023:

2. **PMID: 35944069** - **157,331 citations** (August 2022)
   - A data compendium of 12,289 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* isolates with resistance phenotypes to 13 antibiotics

3. **PMID: 35780211** - **99,144 citations** (July 2022)
   - Convolutional neural network for predicting antimicrobial resistance in *M. tuberculosis*

4. **PMID: 37823632** - **28,377 citations** (October 2023)
   - Comparison of invasive and non-invasive *Streptococcus pneumoniae* isolates for AMR determinants

### Key Insights:

- The AMR Portal database shows a temporal lag, with the most recent highly-cited publications being from late 2023
- The database version noted is ""Current as of 2025"" with ""Irregular updates from source databases""
- Most citations reference landmark studies on tuberculosis, *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Salmonella*, and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* resistance
- The 2023 publications are beginning to accumulate citations but haven't yet reached the citation levels of earlier landmark papers from 2020-2022

**Attribution:** According to PubMed and the AMR Portal RDF Database.

**DOIs:**
- 10.1038/s41467-023-43516-4 (PMID: 38052776)

Let me provide the user with the information I've gathered, explaining the limitations of the data sources:

Based on my search of the PDB database, I can provide you with the following information about antibody structures deposited since 2020:

## Summary

Unfortunately, I encountered limitations in getting an exact count from the available data sources:

1. **Total antibody structures in PDB**: The keyword search tool found **11,475 total antibody structures** across all years in the PDB database.

2. **SPARQL endpoint limitations**: The RDF/SPARQL endpoint I queried appears to contain only a small subset of the full PDB data (only 64 antibody structures with proper metadata), which makes it difficult to get an accurate count filtered by deposition date.

3. **Publication proxy**: Searching PubMed for papers about antibody structures with PDB depositions from 2020-2024 returned **at least 118 publications**, which likely represent several hundred new structure depositions (as each paper may report multiple structures).

## Estimate

Based on the available data and PDB growth trends:
- The PDB has been receiving approximately **15,000-20,000 new structures per year** in recent years
- Antibody/immunoglobulin structures typically represent about **5-8% of annual depositions**
- This suggests roughly **3,000-5,000 antibody structures** have likely been deposited since 2020

To get the exact number, you would need to query the official RCSB PDB website directly (https://www.rcsb.org/), which has advanced search capabilities that can filter by:
- Deposition date range (2020-present)

117,2026-01-09,Specificity,What percentage of AMR Portal isolates are from human hosts versus non-clinical sources?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have specific percentage data about the distribution of host types in the AMR Portal isolates readily available in my training knowledge.

The AMR Portal (Antimicrobial Resistance Portal) aggregates data from various sources including clinical and surveillance databases, but the exact breakdown between human hosts versus non-clinical sources (such as environmental samples, animal sources, or food samples) would depend on:

1. The specific databases included in the portal
2. The time period of data collection
3. Which contributing organizations submit data
4. The portal's scope and focus

Generally, AMR surveillance databases tend to be heavily weighted toward clinical human isolates since clinical infections drive most AMR monitoring efforts. However, One Health approaches to AMR surveillance increasingly include environmental, animal, and food sources.

To get accurate current percentages, you would need to:
- Query the AMR Portal directly
- Check their published statistics or annual reports
- Look at their data summary pages or documentation

Is there a specific AMR database or surveillance system you're interested in, or would you like information about general trends in AMR surveillance source distributions?",,7.862478971481323,55,239,True,True,0.75,"Perfect! Based on the query results from the AMR Portal database, I can now calculate the percentages:

**AMR Portal Isolate Distribution by Host Source:**

- **Human (Homo sapiens)**: 94,120 isolates → **79.5%**
- **Non-clinical sources**: 24,308 isolates → **20.5%**

Out of a total of 118,428 isolates with host information in the AMR Portal:

- **Nearly 80% (79.5%) are from human hosts**
- **About 20% (20.5%) are from non-clinical sources**

This shows that the AMR Portal database is heavily weighted toward human clinical isolates, which makes sense given the focus on antimicrobial resistance surveillance in human health. The ""other (non-clinical isolate)"" category likely includes isolates from environmental sources, animals, food products, and other non-human origins.

It's worth noting that these figures are based on isolates that have host information recorded. There may be additional isolates in the database without host metadata, but among those with recorded host information, the human-to-non-clinical ratio is approximately 4:1.",,32.191006898880005,15,585,11212,89744,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?host (COUNT(DISTINCT ?bioSample) as ?isolateCount)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:bioSample ?bioSample .\n  ?s amr:host ?host .\n}\nGROUP BY ?host\nORDER BY DESC(?isolateCount)""}}]",CRITICAL,"73% Homo sapiens, 27% other (non-clinical)","Database: AMR Portal.

118,2026-01-09,Specificity,What ChEBI role classification is assigned to ATP in PubChem?,True,False,True,0.6666666666666666,"I don't have certain knowledge of the specific ChEBI role classification assigned to ATP in PubChem's database. 

However, I can tell you that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) typically has several ChEBI role classifications, which commonly include:

- **Fundamental metabolite role** - as it's essential for energy metabolism
- **Cofactor role** - as it participates in many enzymatic reactions
- **Purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate** - based on its chemical structure

PubChem integrates data from multiple sources including ChEBI, and the specific role classifications displayed there may include some or all of these categories, but I cannot state with certainty which exact ChEBI role classification(s) appear in PubChem's entry for ATP without access to that specific database record.",,5.972437143325806,53,188,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"Based on my investigation of ATP (PubChem CID 5957, ChEBI ID: CHEBI:15422) in the PubChem RDF database, I found the following:

## ChEBI Role Classification for ATP in PubChem:

The only **ChEBI role** classification explicitly assigned to ATP in PubChem's RDF data is:
- **FDA Approved Drug** (as indicated by the relationship `obo:RO_0000087`)

## Structural Classifications (Not Roles):

While ATP is classified structurally in ChEBI as:
- Adenosine 5'-phosphate
- Purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate  
- Adenyl ribonucleotide
- Nucleotide
- And many other structural/chemical classifications

These are **chemical structure classifications**, not **role classifications**. In ChEBI ontology, ""roles"" specifically refer to the functional or application aspects of a compound (like ""drug"", ""metabolite"", ""cofactor"", etc.), which use the `RO_0000087` (""has role"") relationship.

121,2025-12-23,Structured Query,Which antibiotics are likely effective against Enterococcus faecalis that is resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin but remains susceptible to gentamicin?,True,True,False,0.0,"For ampicillin- and vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus faecalis* (VRE) that remains susceptible to gentamicin, treatment options are limited but include:

## Primary Options:

**1. Linezolid**
- Oxazolidinone class antibiotic
- Typically effective against VRE
- Bacteriostatic against enterococci
- Good tissue penetration

**2. Daptomycin**
- Lipopeptide antibiotic
- Bactericidal activity
- Higher doses (8-12 mg/kg) often needed for enterococcal infections
- NOT effective for pneumonia (inactivated by surfactant)

**3. Tigecycline**
- Glycylcycline antibiotic
- Usually active against VRE
- Limited by bacteriostatic activity and lower serum levels
- Better for intra-abdominal/soft tissue infections

## Combination Therapy Consideration:

**Gentamicin synergy with other agents:**
- Since this isolate is gentamicin-susceptible (unusual for high-level resistance), gentamicin could potentially be combined with:
  - Daptomycin
  - Linezolid
  - Other cell wall-active agents (if any partial activity exists)
- However, gentamicin alone is insufficient for enterococcal infections

## Important Notes:
- Formal susceptibility testing is essential to confirm activity
- Combination therapy may be warranted for serious infections (endocarditis, bacteremia)
- Newer agents like oritavancin or tedizolid may have activity but with less clinical data for enterococci

The specific choice depends on infection site, severity, and patient factors.",,11.056354999542236,75,409,True,False,0.0,"Based on the PubMed literature search, for **Enterococcus faecalis** that is resistant to both ampicillin and vancomycin but remains susceptible to gentamicin, the following antibiotics are likely to be effective:

## Recommended Treatment Options:

### 1. **Linezolid**
According to PubMed, linezolid is consistently mentioned as an effective option for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.21399) This oxazolidinone antibiotic is bacteriostatic and maintains good activity against multidrug-resistant E. faecalis.

### 2. **Daptomycin**
Daptomycin is another important option for VRE infections and is often used for serious enterococcal infections including bacteremia and endocarditis when standard therapies fail.

### 3. **High-Level Gentamicin Synergy Combinations**
Since the strain remains susceptible to gentamicin, synergistic combination therapy may be considered:
- **Gentamicin + an alternative cell wall-active agent** (if any susceptibility exists to other beta-lactams)
- However, the studies indicate that high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLA) is increasingly common (54.55% in E. faecalis according to one study [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.21399))

### 4. **Meropenem + Ceftaroline**
According to PubMed research, this combination showed significant activity against E. faecalis with penicillin MICs ≤2 μg/mL. The combination demonstrated enhanced killing with no regrowth or MIC increases [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00426-22). This may be considered as an alternative to ampicillin-based regimens.

### 5. **Nitrofurantoin** (for urinary tract infections only)
For UTIs specifically, nitrofurantoin showed 69.69% sensitivity against E. faecalis isolates [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.21399)

### 6. **Fosfomycin** (for urinary tract infections only)
For UTIs, fosfomycin demonstrated 78.79% sensitivity against E. faecalis [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.21399)

### 7. **Nitroxoline** (for urinary tract infections)
An in vitro study showed nitroxoline had favorable activity against E. faecalis and could be effective for uncomplicated UTIs [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.10.010)

## Important Considerations:

- The specific infection site matters significantly for treatment selection
- For **serious infections** (bacteremia, endocarditis): Linezolid or daptomycin are typically preferred
- For **urinary tract infections**: Nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or nitroxoline may be appropriate
- **Susceptibility testing** is critical given the high rates of resistance
- The studies noted concerning trends with E. faecalis resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin being increasingly common [DOI](https://doi.org/10.18295/2075-0528.2904)

122,2025-12-23,Structured Query,Is Helicobacter pylori that is resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin likely to remain susceptible to tetracycline?,True,True,True,1.0,"Yes, **Helicobacter pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin are likely to remain susceptible to tetracycline**.

Here's why:

## Different Resistance Mechanisms

1. **Clarithromycin resistance**: Primarily caused by point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene (most commonly A2143G, A2142G, A2142C)

2. **Levofloxacin resistance**: Results from mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA and, less commonly, gyrB genes

3. **Tetracycline resistance**: Caused by mutations in the 16S rRNA gene, particularly at positions 965-967 (AGA→TTC triple mutation)

## Key Points

- **Independent mechanisms**: Since these antibiotics have different molecular targets and distinct resistance mechanisms, resistance to one does not predict resistance to another

- **Low tetracycline resistance rates**: Tetracycline resistance in H. pylori remains relatively rare globally (typically <5% in most regions), even in areas with high clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance

- **No cross-resistance**: There is no known cross-resistance between these antibiotic classes

## Clinical Relevance

This is why **bismuth quadruple therapy** (containing tetracycline) is often used as rescue therapy after failure of clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens. Tetracycline remains a reliable option even when resistance to other antibiotics is present.

However, susceptibility testing when available is always ideal to confirm this assumption.",,10.182382106781006,72,374,True,True,1.0,"Based on recent research from PubMed, **yes, H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin are very likely to remain susceptible to tetracycline**. Here's what the data shows:

## Key Findings on Tetracycline Resistance

1. **Extremely Low Tetracycline Resistance Rates:**
   - A 2025 Taiwan study found only **0.8% tetracycline resistance** overall, despite 18.0% clarithromycin resistance and 28.7% levofloxacin resistance ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v31.i39.111380))
   - In a Taiwan refractory infection cohort with 89.9% clarithromycin resistance and 86.2% levofloxacin resistance, tetracycline resistance was only **15.6%** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848251404379))
   - Chinese Yi population study showed **0.4% tetracycline resistance** vs 22.9% clarithromycin and 39.7% levofloxacin resistance ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaf411))

2. **Independent Resistance Mechanisms:**
   The low correlation between tetracycline resistance and clarithromycin/levofloxacin resistance suggests these antibiotics have different resistance mechanisms:
   - **Clarithromycin resistance**: Primarily 23S rRNA mutations
   - **Levofloxacin resistance**: DNA gyrase mutations
   - **Tetracycline resistance**: Rare, different mechanism

3. **Clinical Implications:**
   Multiple studies recommend tetracycline-based regimens (like bismuth-tetracycline-metronidazole quadruple therapy) specifically because tetracycline maintains high susceptibility even in multi-drug resistant strains.

## Important Caveat

While tetracycline resistance is generally very low, the Taiwan longitudinal study noted a concerning trend: tetracycline resistance increased from **0% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2024** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v31.i39.111380)), suggesting this may be changing over time in some regions.

**Bottom line:** Tetracycline remains highly effective even against clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-resistant H. pylori, making it an excellent choice for rescue therapy after treatment failures.",,44.82811903953552,12,872,39302,47301,"mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata","[{""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__search_articles"", ""input"": {""query"": ""Helicobacter pylori clarithromycin levofloxacin tetracycline resistance"", ""max_results"": 20, ""date_from"": ""2020""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata"", ""input"": {""pmids"": [""41424966"", ""41392259"", ""41361974"", ""41278167"", ""41264394"", ""41264393"", ""41202924"", ""41195999"", ""41180781"", ""41118015""]}}]",VALUABLE,Yes,"Database: BacDive.
