However, I can tell you that reactions involving both ATP and ADP as participants are quite common in biochemistry and typically include:

1. **Adenylate kinase reactions** - These catalyze the interconversion: 2 ADP ⟷ ATP + AMP, so both ATP and ADP participate.

2. **Coupled phosphorylation reactions** - Where ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP) is coupled to another phosphorylation reaction that might regenerate ATP.

3. **Complex multi-step enzymatic reactions** - Where ATP is consumed in one step and ADP is either a product or a substrate in another step of the same overall reaction.

4. **Nucleoside diphosphate kinase reactions** - These can involve ATP donating a phosphate to produce ADP, while another nucleoside diphosphate accepts it.

To get the specific Rhea reaction identifiers and complete details about reactions involving both ATP and ADP, you would need to query the Rhea database directly at their website or through their API.",,8.261487245559692,51,276,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"Great! I found many Rhea reactions that involve both ATP and ADP. From the search results, I can see numerous biochemical reactions where ATP is consumed and ADP is produced as a product. Let me provide you with a summary of the types of reactions:

## Rhea Reactions Involving Both ATP and ADP

Based on the search results, I found **at least 97 reactions** where both ATP and ADP are participants. These reactions fall into several categories:

### 1. **ATP-driven Transport Reactions (ABC Transporters and P-type ATPases)**
These use ATP hydrolysis to transport ions and molecules across membranes, producing ADP:
- **Ion pumps**: K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cu⁺/Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe³⁺, Cd²⁺, Ag⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺
  - Example: **RHEA:18353** - K⁺/Na⁺ ATPase: `K⁺(out) + Na⁺(in) + ATP + H2O = K⁺(in) + Na⁺(out) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`
  
- **Anion transporters**: sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, molybdate, tungstate, thiosulfate, arsenite
  - Example: **RHEA:10192** - Sulfate transport: `sulfate(out) + ATP + H2O = sulfate(in) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

- **Nutrient transporters**: amino acids, sugars (maltose, galactose, xylose, ribose, arabinose, allose), glycerol-3-phosphate
  - Example: **RHEA:29895** - Glutamine transport: `L-glutamine(out) + ATP + H2O = L-glutamine(in) + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

- **Specialized transporters**: bile salts, peptides, lipids, heme, vitamin B1, antibiotics

### 2. **Phosphorylation Reactions**
ATP phosphorylates substrates, producing ADP:
- **RHEA:10272** - Diacylglycerol kinase: `a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol + ATP = a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate + ADP + H⁺`
- **RHEA:15669** - DNA 5'-end phosphorylation: `a 5'-end dephospho-2'-deoxyribonucleoside-DNA + ATP = a 5'-end 5'-phospho-2'-deoxyribonucleoside-DNA + ADP + H⁺`
- **RHEA:54580** - RNA 5'-end phosphorylation: `a 5'-end dephospho-ribonucleoside-RNA + ATP = a 5'-end 5'-phospho-ribonucleoside-RNA + ADP + H⁺`

### 3. **Nucleotide Kinase Reactions**
Transfer of phosphate between nucleotides:
- **RHEA:23100**: `dAMP + ATP = dADP + ADP`
- **RHEA:25094**: `dCMP + ATP = dCDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:12697**: `dGMP + ATP = dGDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:13517**: `dTMP + ATP = dTDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:30655**: `dUMP + ATP = dUDP + ADP`
- **RHEA:11216**: `a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-phosphate + ATP = a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate + ADP`

### 4. **Proton Pumps**
- **RHEA:20852**: `ATP + H2O + H⁺(in) = ADP + phosphate + 2 H⁺(out)`
- **RHEA:57720**: `ATP + H2O + 4 H⁺(in) = ADP + phosphate + 5 H⁺(out)`

### 5. **Nucleotide/Nucleoside Exchange**
- **RHEA:34999** - ADP/ATP antiporter: `ADP(in) + ATP(out) = ADP(out) + ATP(in)`

### 6. **Other ATP Hydrolysis Reactions**
- **RHEA:13065** - Simple ATP hydrolysis: `ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate + H⁺`
- **RHEA:18617** - PEP carboxykinase: `oxaloacetate + ATP = phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP + CO2`
- **RHEA:10348** - 5-oxoprolinase: `5-oxo-L-proline + ATP + 2 H2O = L-glutamate + ADP + phosphate + H⁺`

### Common Pattern:
Most of these reactions follow the general pattern of **ATP hydrolysis coupled to work**:
```
ATP + H2O → ADP + phosphate + H⁺
```

The energy released from breaking the high-energy phosphate bond in ATP is used to drive energetically unfavorable processes like active transport, phosphorylation, or biosynthesis.

103,2026-01-09,Currency,What percentage of NANDO diseases currently have MONDO mappings?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have specific, current statistics about the percentage of NANDO (Nanbyo Disease Ontology) diseases that have MONDO (Monarch Disease Ontology) mappings in my training knowledge.

However, I can provide some context: NANDO is a Japanese disease ontology focused on rare and intractable diseases (nanbyo), and MONDO is a global disease ontology that aims to integrate and harmonize disease classifications from multiple sources. There have been ongoing efforts to map NANDO to MONDO to improve interoperability between Japanese and international disease databases.

To get the current percentage, you would need to:
1. Query the latest versions of both ontologies
2. Check mapping files or cross-references between NANDO and MONDO
3. Review recent publications or documentation from the NANDO or MONDO projects

The percentage likely changes over time as both ontologies evolve and mapping efforts continue.",,6.991398334503174,51,201,True,False,0.0,"Based on the SPARQL queries I just ran on the NANDO database:

- **Total NANDO diseases**: 2,777
- **NANDO diseases with MONDO mappings**: 2,150
- **Percentage**: 2,150 / 2,777 = **77.4%**

This means that over three-quarters of the Japanese intractable diseases cataloged in NANDO have been successfully mapped to the international MONDO Disease Ontology, which is quite a high coverage rate and facilitates international disease harmonization and cross-database research.

- **Experimental validation** - Literature-based evidence of resistance phenotypes
- **Genomic context** - Location on mobile genetic elements or proximity to other resistance genes

## How to search PubChem:

To find these compounds yourself on PubChem:
1. Use the Advanced Search feature
2. Filter by ""Molecular Weight"" < 300
3. Filter by ""Pharmacology"" annotations for FDA approval status
4. Look for compounds with ""Drug"" classifications

Many small molecule drugs fall under this category, particularly older, simpler medications. The 300 Da cutoff includes many oral drugs that follow ""Lipinski's Rule of Five"" principles for drug-likeness.",,10.234111309051514,60,401,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! Now let me compile a comprehensive summary of the findings.

I can't execute database searches or access current data from external resources.

However, I can tell you how you would perform this search:

## How to Search ClinVar for BRCA1 Pathogenic Variants:

**On the ClinVar website (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/):**

1. **Basic search approach:**
   - Search for: `BRCA1[gene] AND (pathogenic[clin] OR likely pathogenic[clin])`
   - Then filter by ""Last Updated"" date to show only entries updated after 2024

2. **Advanced search filters:**
   - Gene: BRCA1
   - Clinical significance: Select ""Pathogenic"" and ""Likely pathogenic""
   - Last evaluated/updated: After January 1, 2024

3. **Alternative using the API or download:**
   - Download the ClinVar variant summary file
   - Filter programmatically for BRCA1 variants with the desired classification and update dates

## What you would typically find:

BRCA1 pathogenic variants are commonly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The database typically contains hundreds to thousands of such variants, including:
- Frameshift mutations
- Nonsense mutations
- Splice site variants
- Missense variants in critical domains

For the most current and accurate data, you would need to query ClinVar directly at the time you need the information.",,10.155426025390625,64,352,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! I found comprehensive data on BRCA1 variants. Based on the results, I can see these variants were evaluated/updated in 2025 (after 2024 as you requested). Here's a summary:
