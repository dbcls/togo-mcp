   - Specific activity relationships

## Example Query Approach:

Using ChEMBL web interface or API, you would search for:
- **Target Type**: ""SINGLE PROTEIN"" with kinase classification
- **Standard Type**: ""IC50""
- **Standard Value**: < 100 (with units in nM)
- **Standard Relation**: ""="" or ""<""

## What You'd Find:

ChEMBL contains **hundreds of thousands** of such compounds, as kinase inhibitors are heavily studied in drug discovery. Many approved kinase inhibitors (like imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib) have IC50 values well below 100 nM against their target kinases.

## Recommended Tools:

- **ChEMBL website** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
- **ChEMBL API** or **Python client**
- **SQL queries** if using downloaded ChEMBL database

Based on my training knowledge, here are some key GO terms in the biological_process namespace related to DNA repair:

**Main DNA repair terms:**

- **GO:0006281 - DNA repair**: The process of restoring DNA after damage. This is the primary/parent term for DNA repair processes.

**Specific DNA repair pathway terms include:**

- **GO:0006289 - nucleotide-excision repair**: Repair system that removes damaged nucleotides and replaces them
- **GO:0006284 - base-excision repair**: Repair of individual damaged bases
- **GO:0006302 - double-strand break repair**: Repair of breaks in both DNA strands
- **GO:0000724 - double-strand break repair via homologous recombination**
- **GO:0006303 - double-strand break repair via non-homologous end joining**
