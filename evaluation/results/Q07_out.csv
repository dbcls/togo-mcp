- **The specific AMR portal or database** being referenced (e.g., WHO GLASS, ECDC, CDC, national systems)
- **The country or region** providing data
- **The type of surveillance system** (some are newer than others)

Many major AMR surveillance systems began collecting standardized data in the 2010s, with some having retrospective data from earlier years. For example, WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) was established in 2015, though participating countries may have historical data predating this.

The AMR surveillance data in the AMR Portal spans **114 years**, from:

- **Earliest year**: 1911
- **Latest year**: 2025
- **Total distinct collection years**: 92 years represented

### Key Points:

1. **Broad Historical Coverage**: The data includes antimicrobial susceptibility test results collected over more than a century, though the distribution is not uniform across all years.

2. **Data Concentration**: According to the database documentation, while the temporal range extends from 1911 to 2025, the data is concentrated in recent decades. About **85% of phenotypic measurements include temporal data** (collection year information).

3. **Data Sources**: The temporal data comes from multiple integrated sources:
   - NCBI Pathogen Detection
   - PATRIC
   - CABBAGE (published literature data from PubMed)

4. **Coverage**: With approximately 1.7 million phenotypic measurements in the database, this represents a substantial longitudinal dataset for tracking antimicrobial resistance trends over time, particularly valuable for temporal trend analysis of resistance patterns.

This extensive temporal coverage makes the AMR Portal particularly useful for studying the evolution and emergence of antimicrobial resistance patterns across different bacterial species and antibiotics over the past century.",,26.98270273208618,15,640,11195,89741,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT (MIN(?year) as ?earliestYear) (MAX(?year) as ?latestYear) (COUNT(DISTINCT ?year) as ?distinctYears)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:collectionYear ?year .\n}\n""}}]",CRITICAL,1911 to 2025 (92 years),Database: AMR Portal.

81,2026-01-09,Specificity,What percentage of AMR Portal phenotypes have quantitative MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) measurements?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have specific statistics about the AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance) Portal's phenotype data distribution in my training knowledge.

However, I can provide some general context about AMR data:

**Typical AMR phenotype measurements include:**
1. **Quantitative MIC values** - exact concentration measurements (e.g., 4 μg/mL)
2. **Categorical interpretations** - Susceptible (S), Intermediate (I), Resistant (R)
3. **Qualitative results** - positive/negative or presence/absence

In many AMR databases and surveillance systems, the proportion of quantitative MIC data versus categorical data varies considerably depending on:
- The source laboratory (clinical labs often report only S/I/R, while research labs report MICs)
- The testing method used (automated systems, broth microdilution, disk diffusion)
- Data collection standards and requirements

To get the accurate percentage for the specific AMR Portal you're asking about, you would need to:
- Query the portal's database directly
- Check their data documentation or metadata
- Contact the portal administrators

Is there a specific AMR Portal you're referring to (e.g., NCBI's Pathogen Detection Portal, WHO's GLASS, CDC's AR data)?",,9.305385112762451,61,290,True,False,0.0,"Based on the query results from the AMR Portal database, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer:

## Answer

**Approximately 75.8% of AMR Portal phenotypes have quantitative MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) measurements.**

### Detailed Statistics:

- **Total phenotype measurements**: 1,714,486
- **Phenotypes with MIC measurements**: 1,299,368
- **Percentage**: **75.8%**

### MIC Measurement Sign Distribution:

The quantitative MIC measurements use various comparison operators to indicate the relationship between measured and actual values:

| Measurement Sign | Count | Percentage of MIC data |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------|
| ≤ | 432,997 | 33.3% |
| == | 401,615 | 30.9% |
| = | 258,571 | 19.9% |
| > | 162,417 | 12.5% |
| ≥ | 28,436 | 2.2% |
| < | 9,994 | 0.8% |
| >,< | 5,338 | 0.4% |

The presence of inequality signs (≤, >, ≥, <) indicates cases where the actual MIC value exceeded the testing range limits, which is common in clinical microbiology when dilution series have upper or lower boundaries.

This high percentage (75.8%) of quantitative MIC data makes the AMR Portal particularly valuable for dose-response analysis and quantitative antimicrobial resistance studies, as opposed to databases that only contain qualitative susceptibility classifications (resistant/susceptible/intermediate).",,34.55555081367493,21,966,11549,127181,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) as ?totalPhenotypes)\n  (SUM(IF(BOUND(?micValue), 1, 0)) as ?phenotypesWithMIC)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  OPTIONAL { ?s amr:measurementValue ?micValue . }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT \n  ?measurementSign \n  (COUNT(*) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:measurementValue ?micValue .\n  ?s amr:measurementSign ?measurementSign .\n}\nGROUP BY ?measurementSign\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n""}}]",CRITICAL,~30%,Database: AMR Portal.

## What I can tell you:

**Signal peptides** are short amino acid sequences (typically 15-30 residues) at the N-terminus of proteins that direct them to the secretory pathway. They're cleaved off after the protein crosses the membrane.

**UniProt reviewed proteins** (Swiss-Prot entries) that contain signal peptides are extremely numerous and include:

### Major protein categories:
1. **Secreted proteins** - hormones, cytokines, antibodies
2. **Membrane proteins** - receptors, channels, transporters
3. **Lysosomal proteins**
4. **Proteins destined for organelles** in the secretory pathway

### Examples of well-known proteins with signal peptides:
- Insulin
- Immunoglobulins (antibodies)
- Serum albumin
- Many cytokines and growth factors
- Extracellular matrix proteins

### Scale:
Signal peptides are found in approximately **15-30% of all proteins** across different organisms, so in UniProt/Swiss-Prot (which contains over 500,000 reviewed entries), this would represent tens of thousands of proteins.

**To get the actual current list**, you would need to:
- Query UniProt directly using: keyword:""Signal"" AND reviewed:true
- Use the UniProt API or download their data files

Would you like guidance on how to search for this information in UniProt directly?",,10.13484501838684,53,364,True,True,0.5714285714285714,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about UniProt reviewed proteins containing signal peptides. Let me provide a complete answer to the user.

- Common examples would include drugs and metabolites that have both chemical/biological significance (ChEBI) and clinical relevance (SNOMED CT)

### Example Compound Types Likely to Have Both:
- Pharmaceutical drugs
- Hormones
- Neurotransmitters
- Common metabolites with clinical significance

To actually retrieve this data, you would need to directly access PubChem's database through their website or API.",,9.260368824005127,56,351,True,True,0.8,"## PubChem Compounds with Both ChEBI and SNOMED CT Classifications

I successfully searched PubChem's RDF database and found **numerous compounds** that have both ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) and SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) classifications.
