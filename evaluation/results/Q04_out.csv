37,2026-01-09,Precision,"What is the R-work value for PDB entry 5D8V, one of the highest resolution structures?",True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have access to specific crystallographic statistics for PDB entry 5D8V in my training data. To find the R-work value for this structure, you would need to:

1. Visit the PDB website (rcsb.org or pdbe.org)
2. Search for entry 5D8V
3. Look in the ""Refinement"" or ""Structure validation"" section of the entry

The R-work value is a measure of how well the refined atomic model fits the experimental X-ray diffraction data, with lower values generally indicating better agreement (typical values for high-resolution structures are often in the range of 0.15-0.25 or 15-25%).

If you let me know what the resolution of 5D8V is or provide the R-work value, I'd be happy to discuss what it means in the context of structure quality!",,6.527106761932373,61,196,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! I found the R-work value for PDB entry 5D8V.

## Answer

The **R-work value for PDB entry 5D8V is 0.072 (7.2%)**.

This is indeed an exceptionally high-resolution structure with:
- **Resolution**: 0.48 Å (one of the highest resolution protein structures ever determined)
- **R-work**: 0.072 (7.2%)
- **R-free**: 0.078 (7.8%)

For context, 5D8V is the ultra-high resolution structure of a high-potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP). The very low R-work value (7.2%) indicates excellent agreement between the crystallographic model and the experimental X-ray diffraction data, which is typical for such ultra-high resolution structures. The small gap between R-work and R-free (0.6%) also suggests the model is not overfitted.",,70.86638593673706,42,2216,14135,259290,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_example, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbx: <http://pdbj.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX pdbo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nWHERE {\n  ?refine a pdbo:pdbx_refine ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?reflns a pdbo:refln ;\n           pdbo:refln.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n           pdbo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n  }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?property ?value\nWHERE {\n  ?refine a pdbo:pdbx_refine ;\n         pdbo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         ?property ?value .\n}\nLIMIT 100\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""5D8V"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX PDBo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nWHERE {\n  ?s a PDBo:pdbx_refineType ;\n     PDBo:pdbx_refine.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n     PDBo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?s PDBo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?ref a PDBo:reflnType ;\n         PDBo:refln.entry_id \""5D8V\"" ;\n         PDBo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n  }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_example"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbo: <https://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/pdbj>\nWHERE {\n    ?PDB a pdbo:datablock ;\n        dct:identifier \""5D8V\"" ;\n        pdbo:has_pdbx_refineCategory / pdbo:has_pdbx_refine ?refine .\n    \n    ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n    \n    OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbo:pdbx_refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n    \n    OPTIONAL {\n        ?PDB pdbo:has_reflnCategory / pdbo:has_refln ?reflnObj .\n        ?reflnObj pdbo:refln.d_resolution_high ?resolution .\n    }\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX pdbx: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT ?r_work ?r_free ?resolution\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/pdbj>\nWHERE {\n  ?entry a pdbx:datablock .\n  BIND(STRAFTER(str(?entry), \""http://rdf.wwpdb.org/pdb/\"") AS ?entry_id)\n  FILTER(?entry_id = \""5D8V\"")\n  \n  ?entry pdbx:has_refineCategory/pdbx:has_refine ?refine .\n  \n  ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_R_factor_R_work ?r_work .\n  \n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_R_factor_R_free ?r_free }\n  OPTIONAL { ?refine pdbx:refine.ls_d_res_high ?resolution }\n}\n""}}]",CRITICAL,0.072,Database: PDB.

However, I can tell you that protein tyrosine kinases generally fall under **EC 2.7.10.-** in the Enzyme Commission classification system:

- **EC 2.7.10.1** refers to receptor protein tyrosine kinases
- **EC 2.7.10.2** refers to non-specific protein tyrosine kinases (non-receptor tyrosine kinases)

Reactome likely uses these standard EC classifications when annotating protein tyrosine kinases in their pathway database, but the specific EC number used would depend on which particular tyrosine kinase or group of kinases you're interested in. Reactome may also use more specific EC numbers for individual, well-characterized kinases.

To get the precise EC number as it appears in Reactome, you would need to consult the Reactome database directly.",,6.544149160385132,54,221,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide the answer to the user.

Based on my search of the Reactome database, **protein tyrosine kinases** are associated with two main EC numbers:

## **EC 2.7.10.1** - Receptor protein tyrosine kinase
- Found in **290 reactions** in Reactome
- Examples include:
  - JAK family kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2)
  - Reactions like ""JAK3 is phosphorylated after IL15 stimulation""
  - IL-receptor associated phosphorylation events
  - STAT protein phosphorylation by JAKs

## **EC 2.7.10.2** - Non-specific protein tyrosine kinase
- Found in **2,094 reactions** in Reactome (much more abundant)
- Examples include:
  - SRC family kinases (SRC, LYN, FYN, FRK)
  - PTK2 (FAK - Focal Adhesion Kinase)
  - SYK (Spleen tyrosine kinase)
  - Reactions like ""Autophosphorylation of SRC"" and ""PTK2 autophosphorylates downstream of EGFR""

The distinction between these two EC numbers is:
- **EC 2.7.10.1** is specifically for **receptor** protein tyrosine kinases (often transmembrane receptors)
- **EC 2.7.10.2** is for **non-receptor** protein tyrosine kinases (cytoplasmic kinases)

Both catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on target proteins, but differ in their cellular location and receptor association.",,67.17533278465271,42,2066,43270,307643,"mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""protein tyrosine kinase"", ""rows"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?reaction ?reactionName ?ecNumber\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber ?ecNumber .\n  ?reactionName bif:contains \""'tyrosine' AND 'kinase'\"" option (score ?sc)\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?sc)\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ecNumber (COUNT(?reaction) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber ?ecNumber .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?ecNumber), \""2.7.10\""))\n}\nGROUP BY ?ecNumber\nORDER BY ?ecNumber\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ecNumber ?reactionName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber ?ecNumber .\n  FILTER(?ecNumber = \""2.7.10.1\"" || ?ecNumber = \""2.7.10.2\"")\n}\nORDER BY ?ecNumber\nLIMIT 20""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ecNumber ?reactionName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber ?ecNumber .\n  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?ecNumber), \""^2\\\\.7\\\\.10\""))\n}\nLIMIT 10""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ecNumber ?reactionName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber \""2.7.10.1\"" .\n}\nLIMIT 10""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ecNumber ?reactionName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction a bp:BiochemicalReaction ;\n    bp:displayName ?reactionName ;\n    bp:eCNumber ?ecNumber .\n  FILTER(STR(?ecNumber) = \""2.7.10.1\"")\n}\nLIMIT 10""}}]",CRITICAL,2.7.10.1,Database: Reactome.

### 1. **ChEMBL Web Interface**
- Go to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/
- Use the advanced search to filter by:
  - Target containing ""kinase"" but NOT ""tyrosine""
  - Bioactivity IC50 < 10 nM

### 2. **ChEMBL API or SQL queries**
You could use Python with the ChEMBL web services:

```python
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client

# Search for targets
target = new_client.target
targets = target.filter(target_synonym__icontains='kinase')
# Then filter out tyrosine kinases programmatically

# Search for activities
activity = new_client.activity
activities = activity.filter(
    standard_type='IC50',
    standard_value__lte=10,
    standard_units='nM'
)
```

### 3. **Expected Results**
This search would likely return inhibitors of:
- Serine/threonine kinases (like CDKs, MAPKs, Aurora kinases)
- Lipid kinases (like PI3K)
- Other non-tyrosine kinases
