However, I can tell you what has generally been observed globally regarding ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli during this period, based on my training knowledge:

**General trends (2010-2023):**
- Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli has been **increasing globally**
- Rates vary significantly by region, with higher resistance typically seen in:
  - South and Southeast Asia
  - Parts of Africa
  - Southern and Eastern Europe
  
- Lower rates generally in:
  - Northern Europe
  - Some parts of North America

**Typical patterns observed:**
- Many countries have seen resistance rates rise from 20-30% to 30-50% or higher
- Some regions already had high baseline resistance (>50%) in 2010
- The increase is associated with overuse of fluoroquinolones and spread of resistant strains

| 2016 | 496 | 159 | 325 | 32.1% |
| 2017 | 1,109 | 151 | 945 | 13.6% |
| 2018 | 837 | 20 | 817 | 2.4% |
| 2019 | 2,006 | 139 | 1,856 | 6.9% |
| 2020 | 1,643 | 271 | 1,365 | 16.5% |
| 2021 | 99 | 6 | 93 | 6.1% |
| 2022 | 156 | 92 | 49 | 59.0% |
| 2023 | 215 | 138 | 63 | 64.2% |

### **Key Observations:**

1. **High Variability**: Resistance rates fluctuate significantly year-to-year, ranging from 2.4% (2018) to 64.2% (2023).

2. **Recent Spike**: There's a concerning upward trend in 2022-2023, with resistance rates jumping to **59-64%**, the highest in the entire period.

3. **Mid-Period Peak**: 2014-2015 showed elevated resistance (43-52%), followed by a decline in 2017-2019.

4. **Sample Size Variation**: Testing volume varied considerably, from 99 samples (2021) to 2,006 samples (2019), which may affect year-to-year comparisons.

### **Geographic Distribution (2010-2023):**

| Region | Total Samples | Resistant Isolates | Resistance Rate |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Americas | 7,823 | 957 | 12.2% |
| Europe | 1,989 | 689 | 34.6% |
| Asia | 419 | 239 | 57.0% |
| Africa | 52 | 27 | 51.9% |
| Oceania | 2 | 0 | 0% |

**Regional Insights**: Europe and Asia show notably higher resistance rates (35% and 57% respectively) compared to the Americas (12%), suggesting significant geographic variation in ciprofloxacin resistance patterns.

### **Conclusion:**

While there isn't a simple linear trend, the data reveals concerning patterns: a recent sharp increase in resistance (2022-2023), substantial geographic variation, and overall high resistance rates in certain regions. The data suggests ciprofloxacin resistance in *E. coli* remains a significant and evolving public health concern, particularly in recent years.",,50.56081414222717,26,1942,15293,163561,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__list_databases"", ""input"": {}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?year \n       (COUNT(*) as ?total) \n       (SUM(?isResistant) as ?resistant)\n       (SUM(?isSusceptible) as ?susceptible)\n       (SUM(?isIntermediate) as ?intermediate)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:organism \""Escherichia coli\"" .\n  ?s amr:antibioticName \""ciprofloxacin\"" .\n  ?s amr:collectionYear ?year .\n  ?s amr:resistancePhenotype ?phenotype .\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""resistant\"", 1, 0) as ?isResistant)\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""susceptible\"", 1, 0) as ?isSusceptible)\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""intermediate\"", 1, 0) as ?isIntermediate)\n  FILTER(?year >= 2010 && ?year <= 2023)\n}\nGROUP BY ?year\nORDER BY ?year""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT ?region (COUNT(*) as ?samples) \n       (SUM(?isResistant) as ?resistant)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:organism \""Escherichia coli\"" .\n  ?s amr:antibioticName \""ciprofloxacin\"" .\n  ?s amr:collectionYear ?year .\n  ?s amr:resistancePhenotype ?phenotype .\n  ?s amr:geographicalRegion ?region .\n  BIND(IF(?phenotype = \""resistant\"", 1, 0) as ?isResistant)\n  FILTER(?year >= 2010 && ?year <= 2023)\n}\nGROUP BY ?region\nORDER BY DESC(?samples)""}}]",CRITICAL,Temporal trend data showing year-by-year resistance rates,"Database: AMR Portal.

34,2026-01-09,Specificity,What evidence type is predominantly used for AMR gene prediction in the AMR Portal?,True,True,False,0.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance) Portal, particularly NCBI's Pathogen Detection system and related AMR resources, predominantly uses **sequence-based evidence** for AMR gene prediction.

More specifically, the primary evidence types include:

1. **Nucleotide sequence similarity** - AMR genes are identified by comparing genomic sequences against curated reference databases of known AMR genes

2. **Reference gene databases** - The system primarily relies on curated databases like:
   - **NCBI's Reference Gene Catalog** for AMR genes
   - Other databases integrated into the analysis pipeline

3. **Hierarchical gene family classification** - Genes are classified into AMR gene families based on sequence homology

The prediction is typically done through:
- **BLAST-based or similar alignment methods** to identify AMR genes in bacterial genomes
- **Threshold-based calling** using sequence identity and coverage cutoffs

This is distinct from phenotypic evidence (actual antimicrobial susceptibility testing results), though some portals may integrate both genotypic predictions and phenotypic data when available.

The genotypic/sequence-based approach allows for rapid, automated prediction of AMR potential directly from genomic sequence data without requiring laboratory culture and susceptibility testing.",,9.607900142669678,54,286,True,True,1.0,"Based on the AMR Portal database documentation, I can answer your question about the evidence types used for AMR gene prediction.

According to the data quality statistics in the AMR Portal:

**HMM (Hidden Markov Model)** is the **predominant evidence type** used for AMR gene prediction in the AMR Portal, accounting for **approximately 65%** of genotype features that have evidence type specified.

This is clearly stated in the documentation under the data quality section:
> ""Evidence type in genotype data predominantly HMM (65% of features with evidence type specified)""

The HMM evidence type is used to identify AMR genes through profile-based sequence analysis. When you look at the genotype data structure, each AMR gene feature includes:
- `amr:evidenceType` - specifying the method (predominantly ""HMM"")
- `amr:evidenceAccession` - the identifier for the HMM model used (e.g., ""NF000263.1"")
- `amr:evidenceDescription` - description of the detected feature
- `amr:evidenceLink` - links to NCBI Pathogen Detection annotation evidence

This approach allows for sensitive and specific detection of AMR genes based on sequence similarity to known resistance determinants, which is why it's the primary method used across the ~1.1 million genotype features in the database.",,19.715474843978882,9,410,10941,52647,mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file,"[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}]",CRITICAL,HMM (Hidden Markov Model),Database: AMR Portal.

36,2026-01-09,Structured Query,Identify E. coli isolates from Southeast Asia resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone collected after 2020 in the AMR Portal.,True,False,False,0.0,,,3.011251926422119,75,2,True,False,0.25,"Excellent! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me provide a summary of the findings:

## Summary of Findings

Based on my search of the AMR Portal database, I found **E. coli isolates from Asia that are resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone**. However, there is an important limitation:

### **Key Finding: No isolates after 2020**

The AMR Portal database does not contain any E. coli isolates from Southeast Asia (or Asia in general) that were collected after 2020 and showed dual resistance to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. The most recent isolates with this resistance profile were collected in **2017**.

### **Isolates Found (2012-2017)**

I identified **46 E. coli isolates from Asia** with confirmed resistance to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone:

#### **By Country/Region:**
1. **Bangladesh** (Southern Asia): 16 isolates (2014-2015)
   - ETEC isolates from enterotoxigenic E. coli studies
   
2. **Pakistan** (Southern Asia): 25 isolates (2012-2017)
   - Multiple clinical isolates (PH series and EC series)
   - Most recent: EC_11 (2017)
   
3. **India** (Southern Asia): 2 isolates (2016)
   - Urinary tract infection isolates
   - One particularly concerning isolate (SAMN11638310) showing **extensive drug resistance** including:
     - Ciprofloxacin: MIC ≥256 μg/mL
     - Ceftriaxone: MIC >128 μg/mL
     - Also resistant to meropenem, colistin, gentamicin, and multiple other antibiotics

4. **China** (Eastern Asia): 1 isolate (2013)
   - CRE1493 from rectal swab
   
5. **Hong Kong** (Eastern Asia): 1 isolate (2014)
   - CRE1540 from rectal swab

### **Notable Resistance Patterns:**

Several isolates showed **multidrug resistance** beyond ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, including resistance to:
- Other fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, levofloxacin)
- Other cephalosporins (cefixime, ceftazidime, cefazolin)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
- Macrolides (azithromycin, erythromycin)
- In severe cases: carbapenems (meropenem) and colistin

### **Data Limitation:**

The AMR Portal's coverage for Southeast Asian E. coli isolates is limited to collections made before 2020. The database shows:
- Thailand: data up to 2016
- Most Southeast Asian countries: no data after 2017

**For data collected after 2020**, you would need to consult other sources such as:
- National AMR surveillance programs
- WHO GLASS (Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System)
- Recent published studies in PubMed
- Regional AMR networks

Would you like me to search for more recent publications about this topic in PubMed?",,184.3248209953308,57,8669,27505,720314,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file,
