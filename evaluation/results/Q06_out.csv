61,2026-01-09,Precision,What is the clinical significance of BRCA1 variant c.2244dup in ClinVar?,True,True,True,1.0,"The BRCA1 variant c.2244dup is a well-characterized pathogenic variant with significant clinical importance in ClinVar.

## Clinical Significance:
**Pathogenic** - This variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

## Key Details:

**Molecular consequence:** This is a frameshift variant (also designated as c.2244dupA or p.Glu749Ter) that results from a duplication of a single nucleotide in exon 11 of BRCA1. The frameshift leads to a premature stop codon.

**Cancer risks:** Carriers of this pathogenic BRCA1 variant have significantly increased lifetime risks for:
- **Breast cancer**: Up to 70-80% lifetime risk
- **Ovarian cancer**: Up to 40-50% lifetime risk
- Also increased risks for other cancers including pancreatic cancer

**Clinical actionability:** This variant has important implications for:
- Cancer screening and surveillance protocols
- Prophylactic surgery options (mastectomy, oophorectomy)
- Treatment decisions (PARP inhibitors for BRCA1-associated cancers)
- Family testing and genetic counseling

**Population:** This variant has been reported in multiple families and populations with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

Individuals found to carry this variant should receive genetic counseling and be offered enhanced cancer surveillance and risk-reduction strategies according to established guidelines for BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers.",,10.168195962905884,60,336,True,True,1.0,"Based on the ClinVar data, I found information about the BRCA1 variant c.2244dup. Here's the clinical significance:

## **BRCA1 c.2244dup (p.Asp749fs) - Clinical Significance**

### **Classification: Pathogenic**

**Key Details:**
- **ClinVar Accession:** VCV000856461
- **Variant Type:** Duplication (frameshift)
- **Protein Change:** p.Asp749fs (aspartate 749 frameshift)
- **Genomic Location:** 
  - GRCh38: Chr 17:43093286-43093287
  - GRCh37: Chr 17:41245303-41245304

### **Clinical Information:**

- **Associated Condition:** Hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)
- **Review Status:** Criteria provided, single submitter
- **Last Evaluated:** March 13, 2019
- **Molecular Consequence:** Frameshift variant (also affects intron variant)

### **Clinical Significance:**

This variant is classified as **Pathogenic** for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The duplication of a single nucleotide causes a frameshift mutation that disrupts the normal reading frame of the BRCA1 gene, leading to a truncated or non-functional protein. BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene, and loss of function mutations significantly increase the risk of:

- Breast cancer (especially early-onset)
- Ovarian cancer
- Other BRCA1-associated cancers

Individuals carrying this variant should receive appropriate genetic counseling and may benefit from enhanced surveillance or risk-reducing interventions according to clinical guidelines.

## Approach to Find Human Kinases with ChEMBL Bioactivity Data

**General Strategy:**

1. **UniProt Query for Human Kinases:**
   - Search UniProt for: `(organism:""Homo sapiens"" [9606]) AND (protein_name:kinase OR ec:2.7.*)`
   - EC 2.7.* covers transferases (kinases transfer phosphate groups)
   - Alternatively, use Gene Ontology terms: `GO:0016301` (kinase activity)

2. **Cross-reference with ChEMBL:**
   - Look for UniProt entries with ChEMBL cross-references
   - In UniProt, this appears in the ""Cross-references"" section

**Key Information:**

- **Human kinases**: There are approximately **518 human protein kinases** in the human kinome
- Many of these are well-studied drug targets with extensive bioactivity data in ChEMBL
- Major kinase families include: tyrosine kinases (TKs), serine/threonine kinases (STKs), lipid kinases, etc.

**Well-Known Examples with Abundant ChEMBL Data:**
- EGFR (P00533)
- BRAF (P15056)
- CDK2 (P24941)
- ABL1 (P00519)
- MAPK1/ERK2 (P28482)

**To get the complete list**, you would need to:
1. Download human kinase data from UniProt
2. Filter for entries with ChEMBL database cross-references
3. Verify bioactivity data exists in ChEMBL for each target

Would you like specific guidance on using UniProt's API or specific search syntax?",,11.929579019546509,59,461,True,False,0.4,"Excellent! Now let me compile a comprehensive summary.

## ClinVar Clinical Significance Categories

ClinVar uses the following main clinical significance categories:

1. **Pathogenic** - Variants that cause disease
2. **Likely pathogenic** - Strong evidence suggesting disease causation
3. **Benign** - Variants that do not cause disease
4. **Likely benign** - Strong evidence suggesting no disease causation
5. **Uncertain significance (VUS)** - Insufficient evidence to classify
6. **Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity** - Different submitters disagree
7. **Risk factor** - Variants that increase disease risk
8. **Drug response** - Variants affecting medication response
9. **Other** - Various other categories
10. **Not provided** - No classification submitted

## Approximate Distribution (from my training data)

Based on historical data, the general distribution trends were:

- **Uncertain significance**: Typically the largest category (~40-50%)
- **Benign/Likely benign**: Combined ~30-40%
- **Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic**: Combined ~15-20%
- **Other categories**: Smaller percentages

**Important note**: ClinVar is continuously updated with new submissions and reclassifications, so these numbers change regularly. For current, accurate counts, you would need to query the ClinVar database directly at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ or download their latest data files.",,9.114817142486572,61,362,True,True,0.75,"Perfect! I've successfully queried the ClinVar database and retrieved counts of variants by clinical significance category. Here are the results:

## ClinVar Variants by Clinical Significance Category

### Main Categories (Top 7):

1. **Uncertain significance**: 1,821,577 variants (51%)
2. **Likely benign**: 993,150 variants (28%)
3. **Benign**: 213,802 variants (6%)
4. **Pathogenic**: 200,004 variants (5.6%)
5. **Conflicting classifications of pathogenicity**: 145,497 variants (4%)
6. **Likely pathogenic**: 107,204 variants (3%)
7. **Benign/Likely benign**: 53,812 variants (1.5%)

### Key Observations:

- **Total variants with clinical significance**: ~3.6 million variants
- **Uncertain significance dominates**: Over half of all classified variants have uncertain significance, reflecting the ongoing challenge in interpreting genetic variation
- **Benign variants outnumber pathogenic**: Combined benign/likely benign (1,260,764) far exceeds pathogenic/likely pathogenic (341,881)
- **Conflicting interpretations**: 145,497 variants have conflicting classifications, highlighting disagreements among submitters

### Additional Categories:

The database also includes specialized categories such as:
- **drug response** (2,516 variants)
- **risk factor** (442 variants)
- **association** (366 variants)
- **protective** (43 variants)
- And various combined classifications (e.g., ""Pathogenic; drug response"")
