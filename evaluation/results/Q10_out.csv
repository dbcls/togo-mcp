Key aspects of the notification number system:

1. **Unique Identifier**: Each notified body receives a unique four-digit identification number when it is notified by an EU member state or country participating in the relevant EU legislation.

2. **Traceability**: The number allows for clear identification and traceability of which notified body has assessed and certified a product's conformity with applicable EU directives or regulations.

3. **CE Marking**: When a notified body is involved in the conformity assessment process, its notification number must be affixed to the product alongside the CE marking, indicating third-party certification was required and performed.

4. **Public Database**: The NANDO database uses these numbers to maintain publicly accessible information about each notified body, including their scope of authorization, applicable legislation, and current status.

5. **Official Recognition**: The notification number represents official recognition by the notifying authority that the body meets the requirements to perform specific conformity assessment procedures.

This numbering system provides transparency and allows manufacturers, authorities, and market surveillance bodies to verify the legitimacy and scope of notified bodies involved in product certification.",,9.624486923217773,50,290,True,True,0.8571428571428571,"Based on the NANDO (Nanbyo Data) database documentation, the **notification number system** is used to identify **designated intractable diseases that are eligible for Japanese government support**.

Here are the key details:

## Purpose of Notification Numbers

1. **Government Designation**: Notification numbers (accessed via the property `nando:hasNotificationNumber`) are assigned to diseases officially designated by the Japanese government as intractable diseases requiring special support.

2. **Coverage**: Approximately **88% of diseases in NANDO** (about 2,454 out of 2,777 total diseases) have notification numbers, indicating they are designated for government assistance.

3. **Administrative Function**: These numbers serve as official identifiers in Japan's healthcare policy and patient information systems for:
   - Tracking diseases eligible for government subsidies
   - Coordinating research efforts
   - Managing patient support programs
   - Administrative documentation

## Example

For instance, **Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy** (Kennedy disease) has notification number **""1""**, while **Parkinson's disease** has notification number **""6""**. These numbers are used in official government documentation and healthcare systems to reference these conditions.

## Approach to Find These Structures:

### 1. **Using PDB Website (rcsb.org)**
You can use the advanced search with these criteria:
- **Experimental Method**: Electron Microscopy (EM)
- **Has EMDB ID**: Yes (this ensures an EMDB entry exists)
- **Has PubMed ID**: Yes (this ensures a publication exists)

### 2. **General Information**

Most cryo-EM structures deposited in the PDB will have:
- An associated EMDB entry (with the density map)
- A primary citation with a PubMed ID

This represents the majority of cryo-EM structures, as publication is typically required or expected for deposition.

### 3. **Key Fields to Check**
When viewing a PDB entry, look for:
- **EMDB ID**: Usually formatted as EMD-XXXXX
- **Primary Citation**: With DOI and PubMed ID (PMID)

### 4. **Approximate Numbers**
As of my training data, there are tens of thousands of cryo-EM structures in the PDB, and the vast majority have both EMDB maps and publications. The exact current number would require a database query.

### 5. **Example Structures** (that I know meet these criteria):
- **7BV2** - SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
- **6VSB** - SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  
- **3J9I** - Ribosome structures

I may be able to provide general information about key topics or research areas in antimicrobial resistance.",,8.182312965393066,56,272,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on my analysis of the AMR Portal database and PubMed metadata, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about the most frequently cited publications from 2024 onwards.

## Most Frequently Cited Publications in the AMR Portal from 2024 Onwards

Unfortunately, **there are no publications from 2024 onwards** among the most frequently cited papers in the AMR Portal database. The database primarily references publications from earlier years (2018-2023), which reflects the typical lag time between research publication, data collection, and database integration.

However, I can identify the **most recently published highly-cited papers** (from 2023) in the AMR Portal:

### Top Publication from 2023:

1. **PMID: 38052776** - **108,358 citations in AMR Portal**
   - **Title:** ""National genomic surveillance integrating standardized quantitative susceptibility testing clarifies antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacterales""
   - **Journal:** Nature Communications
   - **Published:** December 5, 2023
   - **Focus:** Genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 4,195 isolates of *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in Japan. The study provides a blueprint for national genomic surveillance integrating standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

### Other Notable Highly-Cited Publications from 2022-2023:

2. **PMID: 35944069** - **157,331 citations** (August 2022)
   - A data compendium of 12,289 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* isolates with resistance phenotypes to 13 antibiotics

3. **PMID: 35780211** - **99,144 citations** (July 2022)
   - Convolutional neural network for predicting antimicrobial resistance in *M. tuberculosis*

4. **PMID: 37823632** - **28,377 citations** (October 2023)
   - Comparison of invasive and non-invasive *Streptococcus pneumoniae* isolates for AMR determinants

### Key Insights:

- The AMR Portal database shows a temporal lag, with the most recent highly-cited publications being from late 2023
- The database version noted is ""Current as of 2025"" with ""Irregular updates from source databases""
- Most citations reference landmark studies on tuberculosis, *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Salmonella*, and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* resistance
- The 2023 publications are beginning to accumulate citations but haven't yet reached the citation levels of earlier landmark papers from 2020-2022

**Attribution:** According to PubMed and the AMR Portal RDF Database.

**DOIs:**
- 10.1038/s41467-023-43516-4 (PMID: 38052776)
- 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001721 (PMID: 35944069)

To find this information, you would need to:

1. Visit the RCSB PDB website (rcsb.org)
2. Use their advanced search function to filter for:
   - Structures containing antibodies (immunoglobulins)
   - Deposition date from 2020 onwards

Alternatively, you could search for terms like ""antibody,"" ""immunoglobulin,"" ""Fab,"" ""scFv,"" or ""nanobody"" with the appropriate date filters.

The number of antibody structures being deposited has been increasing significantly in recent years due to advances in cryo-EM and the pharmaceutical industry's focus on antibody therapeutics, but I cannot provide you with the exact current count without access to the database.",,6.98113489151001,54,198,True,True,1.0,"Good! This shows there are at least 118 publications about antibody structures with PDB depositions from 2020-2024, but this is counting papers, not individual PDB entries. A single paper might report multiple structures, and not all structures get published immediately. 

Let me provide the user with the information I've gathered, explaining the limitations of the data sources:

Based on my search of the PDB database, I can provide you with the following information about antibody structures deposited since 2020:

## Summary

Unfortunately, I encountered limitations in getting an exact count from the available data sources:

1. **Total antibody structures in PDB**: The keyword search tool found **11,475 total antibody structures** across all years in the PDB database.

2. **SPARQL endpoint limitations**: The RDF/SPARQL endpoint I queried appears to contain only a small subset of the full PDB data (only 64 antibody structures with proper metadata), which makes it difficult to get an accurate count filtered by deposition date.

3. **Publication proxy**: Searching PubMed for papers about antibody structures with PDB depositions from 2020-2024 returned **at least 118 publications**, which likely represent several hundred new structure depositions (as each paper may report multiple structures).

## Estimate

Based on the available data and PDB growth trends:
- The PDB has been receiving approximately **15,000-20,000 new structures per year** in recent years
- Antibody/immunoglobulin structures typically represent about **5-8% of annual depositions**
- This suggests roughly **3,000-5,000 antibody structures** have likely been deposited since 2020

To get the exact number, you would need to query the official RCSB PDB website directly (https://www.rcsb.org/), which has advanced search capabilities that can filter by:
- Deposition date range (2020-present)
- Keywords (antibody, immunoglobulin, Fab, etc.)

117,2026-01-09,Specificity,What percentage of AMR Portal isolates are from human hosts versus non-clinical sources?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have specific percentage data about the distribution of host types in the AMR Portal isolates readily available in my training knowledge.

The AMR Portal (Antimicrobial Resistance Portal) aggregates data from various sources including clinical and surveillance databases, but the exact breakdown between human hosts versus non-clinical sources (such as environmental samples, animal sources, or food samples) would depend on:

1. The specific databases included in the portal
2. The time period of data collection
3. Which contributing organizations submit data
4. The portal's scope and focus

Generally, AMR surveillance databases tend to be heavily weighted toward clinical human isolates since clinical infections drive most AMR monitoring efforts. However, One Health approaches to AMR surveillance increasingly include environmental, animal, and food sources.

To get accurate current percentages, you would need to:
- Query the AMR Portal directly
- Check their published statistics or annual reports
- Look at their data summary pages or documentation

Is there a specific AMR database or surveillance system you're interested in, or would you like information about general trends in AMR surveillance source distributions?",,7.862478971481323,55,239,True,True,0.75,"Perfect!

Out of a total of 118,428 isolates with host information in the AMR Portal:

- **Nearly 80% (79.5%) are from human hosts**
- **About 20% (20.5%) are from non-clinical sources**

This shows that the AMR Portal database is heavily weighted toward human clinical isolates, which makes sense given the focus on antimicrobial resistance surveillance in human health. The ""other (non-clinical isolate)"" category likely includes isolates from environmental sources, animals, food products, and other non-human origins.

It's worth noting that these figures are based on isolates that have host information recorded.

- **Cofactor role** - as it participates in many enzymatic reactions
- **Purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate** - based on its chemical structure

- Nucleotide
- And many other structural/chemical classifications

These are **chemical structure classifications**, not **role classifications**. In ChEBI ontology, ""roles"" specifically refer to the functional or application aspects of a compound (like ""drug"", ""metabolite"", ""cofactor"", etc.), which use the `RO_0000087` (""has role"") relationship.

## Typical GO Term Distribution by Namespace

Based on historical GO statistics, the approximate distribution is:

### **Biological Process (BP)**
- **Count**: ~29,000-30,000 terms
- **Percentage**: ~49-51% of all GO terms
- This is typically the largest namespace, covering processes like metabolism, signaling, development, etc.

### **Molecular Function (MF)**
- **Count**: ~11,000-12,000 terms
- **Percentage**: ~19-20% of all GO terms
- Covers activities like catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity

### **Cellular Component (CC)**
- **Count**: ~4,000-4,500 terms
- **Percentage**: ~7-8% of all GO terms
- Describes locations like organelles, complexes, membranes

### **Obsolete Terms**
- **Count**: ~12,000-14,000 terms
- **Percentage**: ~20-23% of all GO terms
- Terms that have been retired or replaced

## Total Approximate Distribution

```
Total GO Terms: ~58,000-60,000 (including obsolete)
Active Terms: ~44,000-46,000

Active Term Distribution:
- Biological Process: ~65-68%
- Molecular Function: ~25-27%
- Cellular Component: ~9-10%
