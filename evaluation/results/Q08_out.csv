## Answer

There are **47 distinct AMR gene classes** represented in the AMR Portal genotype data.

These classes cover a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, with the most prevalent being:

### Top 10 AMR Gene Classes (by frequency):
1. **BETA-LACTAM** - 243,389 genes
2. **AMINOGLYCOSIDE** - 187,430 genes
3. **EFFLUX** - 180,406 genes

   - Regulated by BCL-2 family proteins
   - Leads to cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation

2. **Extrinsic Pathway for Apoptosis** (Death receptor pathway)
   - Initiated by death receptors (e.g., FAS, TNFR1, TRAIL receptors)
   - Formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
   - Direct activation of caspase-8

3. **Execution Phase of Apoptosis**
   - Activation of executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7)

91,2026-01-09,Currency,What mRNA vaccine-related structures have been deposited in PDB since 2020?,True,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on my training knowledge, several mRNA vaccine-related structures have been deposited in the PDB since 2020, primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that are the targets of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines:

## Key Structure Categories:

**1. Spike Protein Structures:**
- Prefusion-stabilized spike proteins (the immunogen in mRNA vaccines)
- Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes
- Spike proteins with mutations from variants of concern
- Structures showing spike in complex with antibodies elicited by vaccination

**2. Spike-Antibody Complexes:**
- Neutralizing antibodies from vaccinated individuals bound to spike/RBD
- These help explain vaccine efficacy and immune response

**3. Variant Structures:**
- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron variant spike proteins
- These structures helped understand immune evasion and vaccine effectiveness against variants

## Notable Examples Include:
- Structures showing the S-2P stabilization mutations (K986P, V987P) used in both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines
- Cryo-EM structures of full-length spike trimers
- Crystal structures of RBD-antibody complexes

The mRNA vaccines encode the spike protein itself, so these structural studies of the spike protein and immune responses to it are directly relevant to understanding mRNA vaccine mechanisms, though structures of the mRNA delivery systems (lipid nanoparticles) or mRNA itself are not typically deposited in the PDB.

## Direct mRNA Vaccine Structures

### 1. **COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Spike Proteins**
- **7XOG & 7XOE**: Cryo-EM structures of the S glycoprotein encoded by COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidate RQ3013 (both postfusion and prefusion states)
- **8VIA**: Structure showing protective effects of human non-neutralizing cross-reactive spike antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination

### 2. **Modified RNA Structures**
- **8PFK & 8PFQ**: Crystal structures of RNA containing **1-methylpseudouridine** (the modified nucleoside used in Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to reduce immunogenicity and increase stability)

### 3. **Antibody Responses from mRNA Vaccination**
- **9CCI & 9CCJ**: Structures dissecting human monoclonal antibody responses from mRNA and protein-based booster vaccinations against XBB1.5 SARS-CoV-2 variant
- **7FJN, 7FJO, 7FJS**: Structures of spike glycoproteins in complex with antibodies targeting variants like B.1.351 (South African variant)

## Related SARS-CoV-2 Spike Structures (Vaccine Targets)

The database contains **113 total structures** related to mRNA vaccines, with many showing:
- Pre-fusion stabilized spike proteins (the target antigen in mRNA vaccines)
- Antibody-spike complexes from vaccinated individuals
- Variant spike proteins (Delta, Omicron subvariants)
- Receptor binding domain (RBD) structures

## Significance

These structures have been crucial for:
1. **Vaccine design optimization** - understanding spike protein stabilization
2. **Modified nucleoside incorporation** - visualizing how 1-methylpseudouridine affects RNA structure
3. **Antibody response characterization** - mapping epitopes targeted by vaccine-induced immunity
4. **Variant surveillance** - guiding booster vaccine updates

Historically:

- **REFMAC5** (from the CCP4 suite) has been one of the most widely used refinement programs, particularly popular in the structural biology community for many years.

- **PHENIX** (particularly phenix.refine) has become increasingly popular and is now one of the most commonly used packages, especially in more recent depositions.

- **CNS** (Crystallography & NMR System) and its predecessor **X-PLOR** were very commonly used in earlier decades but have declined in usage.

- **SHELXL** has been widely used, particularly for small molecule crystallography and also for some macromolecular structures.

- **BUSTER** is another commercial refinement program that has significant usage.

The relative popularity has shifted over time, with PHENIX gaining substantial market share in recent years due to its comprehensive automation and integration of multiple tools. However, REFMAC5 has maintained strong usage throughout, particularly in European crystallography centers.

The exact ranking can vary depending on the time period examined, but REFMAC5 and PHENIX are consistently among the top choices for macromolecular X-ray structure refinement.",,10.884414911270142,56,316,True,True,0.5,"Perfect!

96,2026-01-09,Structured Query,Identify Staphylococcus aureus isolates with mecA gene AND methicillin resistance phenotype from the same BioSample in the AMR Portal.,True,False,True,0.5,"I need to clarify that I cannot directly access or query the AMR Portal database or any external resources in real-time. However, I can explain how you would approach finding this information:

## How to Find mecA+ MRSA Isolates in the AMR Portal

To identify **Staphylococcus aureus** isolates that have both:
1. **mecA gene** (genotypic resistance)
2. **Methicillin resistance phenotype** (phenotypic resistance)

### Typical Approach in AMR Portal:

1. **Navigate to the NCBI Pathogen Detection/AMR Portal**
   - Go to the Isolate Browser or AMR finder section

2. **Apply Filters:**
   - **Organism**: Staphylococcus aureus
   - **AMR Genotype**: mecA (or mecA gene family)
   - **AMR Phenotype**: Methicillin-resistant or Oxacillin-resistant

3. **Search Parameters:**
   - Look for concordance between genotype and phenotype
   - Filter by BioSample to ensure both data types are from the same isolate

### Key Points:

- **mecA gene** encodes altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) conferring methicillin resistance
- Phenotypic testing typically uses **oxacillin** or **cefoxitin** as surrogate markers
- True MRSA should show both genotypic (mecA+) and phenotypic resistance

### Note:
Without direct database access, I cannot provide you with specific BioSample IDs or isolate counts. You would need to perform this query directly in the NCBI Pathogen Detection portal or AMRFinderPlus databases.

Would you like guidance on interpreting such results once obtained?",,11.034518003463745,75,419,True,True,1.0,"## Summary of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates with mecA Gene AND Methicillin Resistance Phenotype

I successfully identified **3,002 unique Staphylococcus aureus isolates** from the AMR Portal that have BOTH:
1. **Genotypic evidence**: mecA gene detection
2. **Phenotypic evidence**: Methicillin resistance (tested with methicillin, oxacillin, or cefoxitin)

### Key Findings:

#### **By Antibiotic Tested:**
- **Methicillin**: 1,684 isolates
- **Cefoxitin**: 893 isolates  
- **Oxacillin**: 549 isolates

#### **Top Geographic Locations:**
1. **United Kingdom**: 1,454 isolates
   - mecA_1: 587 isolates
   - mecA_2: 501 isolates
   - mecA_3: 366 isolates
2. **Netherlands**: 382 isolates (mostly mecA_2)
3. **United States**: 408 isolates
4. **China**: 147 isolates
5. **Brazil**: 95 isolates
6. **Germany**: 83 isolates
7. **Turkey**: 52 isolates
8. **Spain**: 42 isolates

#### **mecA Gene Variants:**
The data shows multiple mecA variants (mecA_1, mecA_2, mecA_3, mecA_4), which likely represent different alleles or sequence variants of the mecA gene responsible for methicillin resistance in MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

#### **Sample Data:**
The first 100 results show isolates from various countries collected between 1990-2014, with detailed BioSample identifiers that can be used for further investigation of genomic sequences, metadata, and associated publications.

These isolates represent confirmed MRSA cases where both the genetic mechanism (mecA gene) and the clinical resistance phenotype have been documented in the same sample, making them ideal for genotype-phenotype correlation studies.",,74.35016012191772,31,2690,19347,221448,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?bioSample ?isolateId ?country ?collectionYear ?geneSymbol ?antibiotic ?phenotype\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  #
