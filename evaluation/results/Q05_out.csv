I can only provide information based on my training data, which has a knowledge cutoff date and doesn't include live updates from surveillance systems.

However, I can share some general knowledge about carbapenem resistance trends in Klebsiella pneumoniae that were observed up to my training period:

## General Trends (based on training data):

1. **Increasing Resistance**: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has been showing concerning upward trends globally, particularly in healthcare settings.

2. **Geographic Variation**: Higher resistance rates have been reported in:
   - Mediterranean countries (Greece, Italy)
   - Parts of Asia (India, China)
   - Latin America
   - Some regions of the United States

3. **Resistance Mechanisms**: The spread is primarily driven by:
   - Carbapenemase-producing enzymes (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM)
   - KPC enzymes being particularly common in certain regions

4. **Resistance Rates**: Some regions reported resistance rates ranging from <1% to >50%, depending on the location and healthcare setting.

**For current, specific data**, I recommend:
- Visiting the WHO AMR Portal directly (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/antimicrobial-resistance)
- Checking your regional surveillance network
- Consulting CDC or ECDC reports for recent data

Would you like me to explain more about carbapenem resistance mechanisms or surveillance methods?",,10.51989197731018,64,370,True,True,1.0,"## Latest Carbapenem Resistance Trends in Klebsiella pneumoniae from AMR Portal

Based on the AMR Portal database, here are the key findings regarding carbapenem resistance in *Klebsiella pneumoniae*:

### **Temporal Trends (2015-2024)**

The resistance rates show significant variation over recent years:

| Year | Total Tests | Resistant Isolates | Resistance Rate |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2015 | 841 | 263 | 31% |
| 2016 | 896 | 703 | **78%** |
| 2017 | 1,203 | 758 | 63% |
| 2018 | 567 | 39 | 7% |
| 2019 | 190 | 139 | 73% |
| 2020 | 72 | 56 | 78% |
| 2021 | 40 | 25 | 63% |
| 2022 | 165 | 58 | 35% |
| 2023 | 151 | 36 | 24% |
| 2024 | 13 | 3 | 23% |

**Note:** The fluctuations likely reflect sampling bias and geographic variation in data collection rather than true temporal trends, as the database integrates data from multiple sources with varying coverage.

### **Carbapenem-Specific Resistance (2020-2025)**

Among different carbapenems tested:

| Antibiotic | Total Tests | Resistant | Resistance Rate |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Imipenem** | 90 | 72 | **80%** |
| **Meropenem** | 213 | 77 | **36%** |
| **Ertapenem** | 137 | 29 | **21%** |
| Doripenem | 1 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Finding:** Imipenem shows the highest resistance rate at 80%, followed by meropenem at 36%.

### **Geographic Distribution (2020-2025)**

Countries with highest carbapenem resistance rates (minimum 10 samples):

| Country | Tests | Resistant | Resistance Rate |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Italy** | 12 | 12 | **100%** |
| **Ireland** | 12 | 12 | **100%** |
| **Tunisia** | 44 | 41 | **93%** |
| **Brazil** | 63 | 54 | **86%** |
| **India** | 27 | 22 | **81%** |
| USA | 248 | 29 | 12% |
| Canada | 15 | 0 | 0% |

**Key Finding:** Mediterranean countries (Italy, Tunisia) and emerging economies (Brazil, India) show critically high resistance rates.

### **Genetic Mechanisms**

The most prevalent beta-lactamase genes in carbapenem-resistant *K. pneumoniae* isolates include:

**Carbapenemase Genes (2020-2025):**
- **NDM-1 variants**: The dominant carbapenemase detected
  - blaNDM-1_1: 42 isolates
  - blaNDM-1_2: 42 isolates
  - blaNDM-1: 15 isolates
  
- Other carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, IMP, VIM): Rarely detected in this dataset

**Other Beta-Lactamase Genes:**
- Generic bla genes (bla_1 through bla_18): Highly prevalent across isolates
- ompC (outer membrane porin): 512 isolates
- ampC variants: Present in carbapenem-resistant strains

### **Clinical Implications**

1. **High resistance rates** in several regions indicate carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) is a major clinical challenge
2. **NDM-1 predominance** suggests metallo-beta-lactamase-mediated resistance is the primary mechanism
3. **Geographic clustering** in Mediterranean and South Asian regions aligns with known epidemiology
4. **Variable resistance by agent** suggests imipenem may be less effective than other carbapenems in tested populations

**Data Limitations:** The AMR Portal aggregates data from multiple surveillance programs with varying sampling strategies, which may affect the representativeness of trends.

The Gene Ontology is continuously updated, with terms being added, modified, or made obsolete regularly.

However, I can tell you that historically, the biological_process namespace is one of the three main GO namespaces (along with molecular_function and cellular_component) and typically contains tens of thousands of terms. As of various snapshots in recent years, it has contained approximately 29,000-30,000+ terms, but this number changes with each GO release.

For the most current and accurate count, you would need to:
1. Check the latest GO release notes at geneontology.org
2. Query the current GO database directly
3. Download the latest GO OBO or OWL file and count the terms in that namespace

60,2026-01-09,Structured Query,Identify PDB structures with resolution better than 1.0 Å determined by X-ray diffraction.,True,False,True,0.5,"Based on my training knowledge, I can provide information about ultra-high resolution protein structures, though I cannot query a database to give you a current comprehensive list.

## Characteristics of Sub-1.0 Å Resolution Structures

Structures with resolution better than 1.0 Å (< 1.0 Å) are extremely rare and represent the highest quality X-ray crystallographic data. At this resolution:
- Individual atoms can be clearly resolved
- Hydrogen atoms may be visible
- Alternative conformations are well-defined
- Bond lengths and angles are very precisely determined

## Known Examples (from my training data):

Some notable structures that have achieved sub-1.0 Å resolution include:

1. **Crambin** - One of the first proteins to break the 1.0 Å barrier (achieved ~0.54 Å in some studies)

2. **Small proteins and peptides** - These are most common in this resolution range due to:
   - Better crystallization properties
   - Less conformational heterogeneity
   - Smaller unit cells

3. **Aldose reductase** - Has structures refined to ~0.66 Å

4. **Some enzymes complexes** with small molecules/inhibitors

## Important Notes:

- As of my training data, there were likely only a few dozen structures in the PDB with resolution better than 1.0 Å
- Most are small proteins (< 150 residues)
- This represents a tiny fraction of the total PDB entries
