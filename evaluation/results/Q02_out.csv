14,2026-01-29,Precision,What is the highest resolution structure ever achieved in the Protein Data Bank?,True,True,True,1.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the highest resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have achieved resolutions better than 0.50 Å (angstroms).

Some of the highest resolution structures include:

1. **Crambin** - Various crystal structures of this small plant protein have achieved resolutions around **0.48 Å**, which has been among the very highest resolutions recorded in the PDB.

2. **Small molecule complexes and peptides** - Some very small proteins or peptides with excellent crystallization properties have achieved sub-0.50 Å resolutions.

The exact ""highest"" resolution can vary as new structures are deposited, but crambin structures have historically held records in this category, with resolutions in the **0.48-0.54 Å range** representing the upper limit of what has been achieved.

It's worth noting that achieving such ultra-high resolutions requires:
- Exceptionally well-ordered crystals
- Small, stable proteins
- Excellent X-ray diffraction data
- Advanced data collection techniques
- Often cryogenic temperatures

These ultra-high resolution structures are relatively rare, as most protein structures in the PDB are solved at resolutions between 1.5-3.0 Å, which is still sufficient for most biological insights.",,8.555876970291138,52,289,True,True,1.0,"Perfect!

2. **PDB ID: 3NIR** - Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 Å resolution

Both structures achieved the remarkable resolution of **0.48 Å**, which represents atomic-level detail where individual atoms and their bonding arrangements can be visualized with exceptional clarity.

For context, this is an extraordinarily high resolution - most protein structures in the PDB are solved at 2-3 Å resolution, and anything below 1.0 Å is considered ultra-high resolution. At 0.48 Å, these structures allow researchers to see fine details like electron density distributions and precise bond geometries that are not visible in typical protein structures.

24,2026-01-29,Structured Query,How many BRCA1 variants in ClinVar are classified as 'Pathogenic' with current record status?,True,False,False,0.2,"I don't have access to real-time ClinVar database information, so I cannot provide you with the current exact number of BRCA1 variants classified as 'Pathogenic' with current record status.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **ClinVar is regularly updated** - the numbers change frequently as new submissions are added and existing records are updated

2. **BRCA1 is highly clinically significant** - it's one of the most studied genes due to its association with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, so it has thousands of variants catalogued in ClinVar

3. **'Pathogenic' classification** - ClinVar distinguishes between different pathogenicity levels including:
   - Pathogenic
   - Likely pathogenic
   - Uncertain significance
   - Likely benign
   - Benign

4. **Record status matters** - ClinVar tracks whether records are current, replaced, or removed

To get the current accurate number, you would need to:
- Query the ClinVar database directly at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/
- Use their API
- Download their latest data releases
